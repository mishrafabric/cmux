/// remote connect ssh://host` runs the user's `/usr/bin/ssh -T host
/// ~/.local/bin/cmux-tui remote-link --stdio --session NAME` and carries
/// framed, resumable links over that one stdio stream (carrier
/// authentication: the SSH account is the identity). Locally it exposes a
/// Unix socket that speaks the same v12 protocol as the local daemon, so
/// the app attaches to it exactly like a Cloud machine's link. This beats
/// `ssh -L` Unix-socket forwarding: no remote socket path to guess, no
/// `StreamLocalBindUnlink`/stale-socket races, no `AllowStreamLocalForwarding`
/// requirement on the server, and the link resumes reliable sequence
/// numbers across short drops instead of resetting every attachment.
///
/// Every ssh gets ``enforcedOptions``: no prompts (the app has no TTY, so a
/// prompt would hang or fail obscurely), and no agent, X11 or port
/// forwarding back to this Mac (a remote machine must not reach local
/// resources through the link). Everything else stays the user's: their
/// `~/.ssh/config`, known_hosts and host key policy (never relaxed), agent,
/// ProxyJump and ControlMaster. cmux never handles a password.
