///
/// - Every link tab records its opener (`TabModel::opener`).
/// - A foreground tab goes right after the opener and first forgets every
///   relation (`ForgetAllOpeners`), then records its own.
/// - A background tab goes after the run of the opener's descendants
///   (children, grandchildren...) that directly follows the opener; the run
///   ends at the first tab outside the family, pinned tabs skipped
///   (`GetIndexOfLastWebContentsOpenedBy`). No run: right after the opener.
/// - A tab that leaves the pane hands its children its own opener
///   (`FixOpeners`).
/// - A user switch between tabs that are not opener and child or siblings
///   (two tabs with the same opener; no opener is not one) forgets every
///   relation (`SetSelection` with a user gesture), and so
///   does a typed navigation (`TabNavigating`), except a new tab page at the
///   end of the strip.
///
/// The daemon commits the tab in the slot (`frontend-browser-insert-after-v1`);
/// this type only names it. Placements for one opener run one at a time:
/// the next slot depends on the tab the previous one made, and the caller's
/// `create` returns only once the store shows that tab
/// (`BrowserTabService.settled`).
