/// Secrets REPL sessions typed into browser tabs, so a typed value stays
/// masked for every session that reads the tab, not only the one that
/// holds the secret.
///
/// A session's own secrets are redacted by that session
/// (``BrowserReplSecretStore``). Another session that drives the same tab
/// (`tabs.use`) does not hold them, so without this its reads of the field
/// (`inputValue`, `evaluate`, a screenshot) would return the value. The
/// driver records each secret it types, by tab, and masks the values other
/// sessions typed in every result, event and capture it hands a session;
/// the session masks them in everything else it hands JavaScript or prints
/// (fetch responses, files written and read back, output lines, errors).
/// The typing session keeps its own store's behavior (a TOTP code it typed
/// stays readable to it). A record lasts until its tab closes; when the
/// typing session leaves, its records mask for every session, including a
/// later session with the same name.
///
/// A record is kept per tab and distinct value, so sessions whose secrets
/// share a name, one session typing a name into several tabs, or typing a
/// name into a tab again with a new value never drop an earlier value: the
/// page may keep it (another field, its history, a hidden copy) until the
/// tab closes. The same value typed into the same tab again is one record,
/// masked on every domain it was typed for.
/// Each value is
/// masked as typed, a literal under an internal key shown as
/// `<secret:name>`: a TOTP secret's typed value is its code, so no TOTP
/// rule (`totp`, or a name ending in `bu_2fa_code`) applies.
///
/// The registry is shared by every session and safe to use from any thread:
/// a session reads it off the main thread for its fetch responses, files
/// and output lines (``BrowserReplDriver/typedSecretRedaction()``).
