/// Executes the REPL's `fs` operations inside a `BrowserReplFileSandbox`.
///
/// Every operation takes and returns JSON-compatible values so the
/// JavaScriptCore bridge can pass them as strings. Errors carry Node error
/// codes so the runtime can build Node-compatible `Error` objects.
///
/// Like Node, `rm`, `rename` and `lstat` act on a symbolic link itself and
/// the other operations act on what it points to. `rename` and `copyFile`
/// replace an existing destination atomically: it stays intact until the new
/// file is complete.
///
/// The path check and the system call are one: every operation walks from
/// its root's directory, held open since the fs first opened it (a rename of
/// the root's path, or a link put in its place, changes nothing), one entry
/// at a time, with `openat` and
/// `O_NOFOLLOW`, and acts on the entry relative to the directory it holds
/// open (`openat`, `fstatat`, `mkdirat`, `unlinkat`, `renameat`). A link on
/// the way is read with `readlinkat` and followed only while it stays inside
/// a root, so neither another session nor another local process can swap a
/// link in for a directory between the check and the use: the directory
/// already open is the one acted on.
///
/// A directory held open stays usable after it is moved, and a session
/// whose root holds another session's root can move a directory below the
/// inner root out of it while an operation of the inner session holds it.
/// So every system call that acts relative to a directory below a root
/// (`openat` of the file or directory acted on, `fstatat`, `mkdirat`,
/// `unlinkat`, `renameat`) runs under ``BrowserReplFileSandbox/pathChangeLock``,
/// which every REPL `fs.rename` holds, right after a walk up the
/// directory's `..` entries reaches the root (by identity): a directory
/// moved out fails the call with `EACCES` and nothing is made, written or
/// removed there. A file already open stays the file that was opened
/// inside the root.
///
/// Files are opened with `O_NONBLOCK` and checked with `fstat` before any
/// read or write: a FIFO, socket or device fails with `EINVAL` at once
/// instead of waiting for its other end, and `readFile` refuses a file over
/// `maxReadFileBytes`. One `writeFile` (also an append) or `copyFile` writes
/// at most ``BrowserReplWriteBudget/maximumBytesPerCall`` and a session at
/// most ``BrowserReplWriteBudget/maximumBytesPerSession`` in all, each
/// refused before anything is written, and they write in chunks that stop
/// when the session cancels the call (its cell timed out or the session
/// closed). No lock is held across operations: the descriptor walk is what
/// keeps two sessions on one root, or a session and another process, from
/// racing each other's checks, and ``BrowserReplFileSandbox/pathChangeLock``
/// is held only for one system call and its directory's check, so a slow
/// operation holds only its own session's thread.
