/// Bounds every JavaScript run on a REPL session's thread.
///
/// JavaScript runs on the session's one thread, so a synchronous infinite
/// loop would hold that thread forever and nothing queued behind it (the
/// timeout's cleanup, the next cell, `close()`) could run. JavaScriptCore's
/// `JSContextGroupSetExecutionTimeLimit` calls a callback on the JS thread
/// once a script has run for `checkInterval` without returning (in practice
/// JavaScriptCore checks every second or two); the callback returns `true` to
/// terminate that script with an uncatchable exception.
///
/// The session enters JavaScript only through ``run(evalID:_:)`` (a cell,
/// a driver result, a timer, an event, a cancel), naming the cell that is
/// running then. A run is terminated when the session asks for it (a cell
/// timed out), once the session closed (for good: nothing clears that), or
/// when it has gone on for `callbackTimeLimit` while the cell it started
/// under is no longer running, or it started under none. Agent code can
/// start work outside a cell (timers, event handlers, promise jobs a later
/// run drains), so every run is bounded, not only cells.
///
/// Runs outside a cell also share a time credit, so a stream of callbacks
/// each under `callbackTimeLimit` cannot hold the thread: the credit holds
/// at most `callbackTimeLimit`, refills at `callbackShare` of wall time, and
/// pays for every run that starts outside a cell; a run gets at most the
/// credit left when it starts. The session holds callbacks back while the
/// credit is in debt (``isInCallbackDebt``) and asks ``timeUntilCredit``
/// when to try again.
///
/// The function is exported by JavaScriptCore but declared in a non-public
