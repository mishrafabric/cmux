/// The session's named secrets (docs/browser-repl/reference-c-parity.md#secrets).
///
/// Values live here, in the native session, and never cross into the REPL's
/// JavaScript: the runtime holds names only, the session substitutes a value
/// into `input.insertText` for the driver, which types it only into a frame
/// whose origin matches the secret's domains, and every string the session
/// hands back to JavaScript or prints (driver results, events, fetch
/// responses, output, errors, files written and read back) is masked as
/// `<secret:name>`, including the value's percent-encoded (also twice),
/// JSON- and JavaScript-escaped, HTML-escaped (numeric references and
/// the legacy named ones, with or without the semicolon), character by character in any mix, and Base64-wrapped
/// forms (a Basic `Authorization` header,
/// Base64 at any offset in a longer run; see
/// ``BrowserReplSecretScanner/minimumBytesAtEveryOffset`` for short
/// values). A value transformed otherwise (compressed, hex, Base64 twice or
/// broken across lines) is not found.
/// Masking is one linear pass (``BrowserReplSecretScanner``) whose growth
/// and work are bounded: text that masking would grow by more than
/// ``maximumGrowth``, or that would take more matching work than its length
/// allows, is withheld, and bytes are refused. A session holds at most
/// ``maximumSecrets`` secrets of at most ``maximumValueBytes`` bytes with at
/// most ``maximumDomains`` domains each, and each value is compiled for
/// matching once, when it is registered.
///
/// A TOTP secret's value is its seed. The codes it generates are secrets too
/// while a server can still accept them (the current 30-second window and
/// the windows on each side, the clock skew RFC 6238 servers allow): they
/// are capture masks for the secret's domains, and in text every whole
/// six-digit number is masked as `<secret:name>` while the session holds a
/// TOTP secret, whatever its digits.
///
/// Masking by value runs over data the agent chooses (what it prints,
/// writes, or has a page echo), so a mask that appears only where the data
/// equals a held value answers the agent's guess. A value from a set the
/// agent can list whole in one call, a TOTP code or a digit-only value of
/// at most ``maximumDigitsMaskedByShape`` digits (a PIN), is therefore
/// masked by its shape (``masksByShape(_:)``): every whole number of its
/// length, as text or a JSON number, gets its mask, and its encoded forms
/// are not looked for. Any other value is masked by value, so a value an
/// agent can guess (a short or dictionary password) can still be confirmed
/// by printing guesses: value masking keeps a value out of what pages and
/// files hand back, not away from an agent that guesses it.
