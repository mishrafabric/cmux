/// a document no decision covered. Every such document starts with a

/// on the web view the delegate answers child-frame navigations only once
/// the last hold comes off (``holdsBack(_:in:until:)``). A child frame then
/// shows nothing but the document it showed at the read, or a new frame's
/// initial empty document, which takes its parent's origin. Main-frame
/// navigations and new windows are not held: a new main document replaces
/// every frame, and a window the agent's click opens must still reach the
/// session while its input is handled.
