# cmux managed preferences

Generated from the cmux settings catalog by `ManagedPreferencesManifest` (CmuxNextSettings). Do not edit by hand; run `CMUX_UPDATE_MDM_SCHEMA=1 swift test --filter ManagedPreferencesManifestTests` in `Packages/macOS/CmuxNext`.

Domain: `com.manaflow.cmux` for every channel (stable, NIGHTLY, DEV). A forced value (any MDM custom settings payload) locks the setting and Settings shows "Managed by your organization". A non-forced value replaces the default and the user can still change it. Precedence, highest first: MDM forced, team policy enforced, the user's cmux.json, MDM non-forced, team policy default, product default.

Chat privacy exceptions: `agents.chats.roots` is the union of user roots and roots added by managed or team layers, deduplicated in layer order. Managed roots are locked rows, but users may still edit their own roots. `agents.chats.enabled` and `agents.chats.discovery` default to true; a forced false from either MDM or team policy turns them off, while a forced true never overrides a user false. Recommended booleans only supply missing user values. All three keys refuse agent writes (`privacy`). Managed chat roots and forced-off values are enforced while the cmux app runs; the acpmux daemon keeps the last values the app sent in its own `chat-settings.json`, so a daemon started without the app uses those values.

Chat roots must be absolute harness data folders. The root folder, home folder, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Music, Movies, Library/Mobile Documents, Library/CloudStorage, Library/Containers, Library/Group Containers, Library/Mail, Library/Messages, Library/Safari, Library/Calendars and their descendants are refused, as are /Volumes, /Network and /net. Checks are case-insensitive and include symbolic links. Refused roots remain visible with a reason, but are never read or sent to the daemon. The protected list mirrors acpmux protected_folders.rs.

The legacy forced key `DisableAutoUpdate` in `com.cmuxterm.app` keeps working.

Files: `com.manaflow.cmux.plist` (ProfileManifests: iMazing Profile Editor, ProfileCreator), `com.manaflow.cmux.json` (Jamf Pro custom schema), `cmux-example.mobileconfig` (any MDM), `com.manaflow.cmux.intune.plist` (Intune preference file).
