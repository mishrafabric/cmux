# cmux-next batch queue

Open a PR into `feat-cmux-next` and let the queue land it. You don't stack, rebase or rerun anything by hand. `scripts/ci/next_batch.py` is the controller. It runs either as `.github/workflows/cmux-next-batch.yml` with a GitHub App, or as `next_batch.py serve` on a workstation under the operator's gh login (see [Serving locally](#serving-locally)).

## What makes a PR eligible

- It isn't a draft, and its branch is in this repository.
- It's by a batch author (the `CMUX_NEXT_BATCH_AUTHORS` variable, default `teamleaderleo`), or anyone else labels it `batch-queue`.
- It has none of the labels `hold`, `exploration`, `needs a call`, `default call`, `do-not-merge` or `wip`.
- Its head commit is less than 5 days old.
- It doesn't change `.github/workflows/`. Those PRs land by hand.
- No check is red outside the heavy tier, except web formatting (`web / react-apps-check`, `web / Web status`) on a PR that changes `webviews/`. Before landing such a PR, the queue runs `bun run check:fix` (formatter and lint autofix) on its head in `regen-linux` and pushes the fix to its branch. That push happens only for a batch author's PR; an opted-in PR by anyone else keeps its red check. gh-merge-green then waits for the rerun.
- Pending checks are fine. The heavy tier is swift test, the Release and scheme compiles, daemon tests, generated files and the cmux-tui wait. The batch runs it once on the stack, so the PR's own copy may be red or still running.

To keep a PR out, add `hold`. A PR the queue dropped at its current head stays out until you push.

## One batch

1. **Trigger.** A PR event or a feat-cmux-next push starts `debounce`. Each new event cancels the waiting run. The batch is dispatched after 2 minutes of quiet, and never later than 10 minutes after the first event. A running batch is never cancelled. A newer dispatch waits for it.
2. **Stack.** Starting from the feat-cmux-next head, the batch merges up to 12 eligible PRs in PR-number order.
   - A conflict in a generated file keeps the stack's copy, and the generator rebuilds it once after the stack is pushed:
     - Web bundles: `scripts/cmux-next/regenerate-web-bundles.sh`, on Linux (`regen-linux`).
     - SDK bindings: `cmux-tui/bindings/codegen/generate.py --write`, on Linux (`regen-linux`).
     - Swift exports such as action contracts, the settings schema and MDM: `scripts/cmux-next/regenerate-swift-exports.sh`, on a mini (`regen`).

     Generators run the stack's code, so they never run on the controller's host. Each job has a read-only token and returns its commit as a patch, which the controller applies and pushes.
   - `cmux-tui/spec/*.json` merges key by key.
   - String catalogs and the Xcode project merge as in `scripts/merge-main.sh`.
   - Any other conflict drops that PR from the batch and comments on it.
3. **Validate once.** The stack is pushed to `next-batch/<run>-<n>`. `cmux-next.yml` is dispatched there, and every tier runs. If the stack changes cmux-tui, `cmux-tui-artifacts.yml` is also dispatched on a `cmux-tui-pin-*` ref. At the same time, a mini submits a fleet `--production` build of the stack. A job that is red on feat-cmux-next itself doesn't count against the batch. Failed jobs get one rerun before any PR is blamed.
4. **Land or bisect.**
   - Green: each PR lands with `gh-merge-green --squash`, using main's copy, after a comment that links the batch. If the PR's own heavy check is red, `--override` names the batch run.
   - Red: the batch tests prefixes of the stack by halving. The last PR of the smallest red prefix is the culprit. It gets a comment with the failing jobs, and the batch reruns without it, for at most 3 culprits per batch.
5. **Report.** The job summary, and the sticky comment on `CMUX_NEXT_BATCH_STICKY` when set (an HQ issue), list each PR's outcome, every validation with its wall time, the heavy-tier run and the build link.

In the workflow, pushes and merges use the `CMUX_NEXT_BATCH_APP_ID` App's token, which needs contents, workflows and pull-requests write. GitHub refuses the job token any branch based on feat-cmux-next. After landing, the batch dispatches `cmux-next.yml` and `cmux-tui-artifacts.yml` on feat-cmux-next, plus the next batch.

## Serving locally

Until the App exists, the queue runs on a workstation that is on the build tailnet, with a gh login that has `repo` and `workflow` scopes:

```bash
CMUX_NEXT_BATCH_STICKY=manaflow-ai/cmuxterm-hq#1392 \
  python3 scripts/ci/next_batch.py serve --worktree ~/.cache/next-batch-stack
```

It polls the open PRs every minute and uses the debounce job's timing: 2 minutes of quiet, at most 10 minutes. It runs one batch at a time and never interrupts one. Its fleet build uses the host's `cmux-ci`. Regeneration and the heavy tier still run on Actions, and only the controller runs locally. Its pushes and merges start CI like anyone's, so nothing is re-dispatched after landing. Comments link the sticky issue. Keep `CMUX_NEXT_BATCH_ENABLED` unset while a local controller serves, so the two never race.

By default `serve` merges nothing. It posts a receipt on each validated PR (the stack, the fleet job and the heavy jobs that passed), and the owner lands it with gh-merge-green. `--land` makes it merge. A receipt says when the heavy tier did not run, which happens when the stack's `cmux-next.yml` predates the next-batch gate.

`run --local` runs one batch the same way, receipts included.

The same poll watches for closes. A batch author's PR that leaves the open set closed and unmerged by someone else goes to `tell-coordinator` (`CMUX_NEXT_BATCH_NOTIFY`), with its number, actor and time. Three or more within 10 minutes send one alert, and later closes in that burst arrive in one summary when it ends. It only reports; it never reopens. Each PR that leaves costs one lookup, and nothing else adds requests.

## Run it by hand

```bash
gh workflow run cmux-next-batch.yml --ref feat-cmux-next -f mode=batch -f dry_run=true   # validate only, no writes
gh workflow run cmux-next-batch.yml --ref feat-cmux-next -f mode=batch -f prs="17505 17508"
python3 scripts/ci/next_batch.py select            # who is eligible, and why the rest aren't
python3 scripts/ci/next_batch.py stack --prs "17505 17508" --no-regen --worktree /tmp/stack
```
