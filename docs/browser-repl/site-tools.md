# Site tools (`sites`)

`sites` is the REPL global for site-specific tools: Google Workspace, Gmail,
Calendar, Search, YouTube, Slack, Notion, LinkedIn, X, GitHub, Linear, Jira,
page assets, WebMCP and a secure sign-in handoff. It covers what reference A's REPL
integrations and reference B's site capabilities offer, with three
rules neither reference enforces together:

1. **The user's cmux browser session is the only credential.** A tool reads
   through the cookie-bearing REPL `fetch` (Google's export endpoints,
   YouTube, GitHub `.diff`/`/raw/`) or in a background tab of the same
   profile, where its code runs in the page's own world against the site's
   own origin. A tool that runs in a site's origin loads a bootstrap page
   there (`/robots.txt`) and runs nothing when a redirect left that origin:
   the call fails with `origin_changed` when the tab's URL is elsewhere, and
   each evaluation first checks its document's own `location.origin`.
   Every background tab a tool opens is bound to the origin of the site
   URL it opened (`withTab`). Its read-backs and waits run only in a
   document on that origin, and the commit protocol checks every bound
   tab's URL and document origin before its first read-back, before each
   click and before each batch of input or request. A tab that a redirect
   or a later navigation took to another origin fails with
   `target_mismatch`, and nothing is sent there.
   A token a site keeps in the page (Slack's `xoxc-` token in
   `localStorage`, LinkedIn's CSRF cookie) is used inside that page and never
   returned. Reference A's `slack.getClient()` and `notion.getClient()` extract
   the token into the REPL; its `imagegen` object printed OAuth tokens in a
   probe.
2. **Reads run directly. Writes that reach other people are drafts.**
   `sites.gmail.send(message)` returns a draft (what will be sent, to whom,
   from which account, and the reference B confirmation category it falls under).
   Nothing happens until `sites.gmail.send(draft.id, { confirm: true })`.
   Reference A's `slack` client posts, `twitter.tweet()` posts and `gmail` compose
   pages send with no gate; reference B has the rule only as policy
   text ([confirmations.md](#confirmation-taxonomy)). cmux enforces it in the
   API: a write without a draft id is a draft, `{ confirm: true }` without a
   draft id is an error, a draft is single-use, expires after 30 minutes and
   lives only in the REPL session that made it. The tool copies its input
   when it makes the draft, and the draft it returns is a frozen copy with
   a frozen preview, so changing the input object, the draft or its preview
   afterwards changes nothing: the confirmed call performs the action the
   preview showed. The status and expiry the confirm step checks stay in the
   session; `sites.drafts.get(id)` reads the current status.
   Every write goes through one draft and commit protocol in
   `sites/loader.js`, so a change of shared browser state another session
   (or the page) makes between the preview and the confirmation never
   redirects it. The draft records a typed intent, which is its preview:
   the **account** that acts, by stable ids (Google's account id from
   ListAccounts and the email at the `/u/` index, the Slack workspace and
   member ids, the LinkedIn member id, the Notion user id, the X account id
   (`id_str`, immutable) and screen name (reusable) that X's
   `verify_credentials` endpoint authenticates, never the page-writable
   `twid` cookie); the **target**, by stable ids (Slack
   channel id and name, the Gmail thread and its message ids and the To,
   Cc and Bcc Gmail's Reply (all) addresses, the Google file id with its
   title and sharing, a Slides object id with its title and position, the
   Notion page, the WebMCP tool's descriptor, the author a LinkedIn post
   goes out as, by URN and type (the member's profile, never a company
   page, which can carry the member's very name) and by name, and its
   audience); and every other field the
   preview shows (**content**). The confirmation prepares the write (opens
   the composer, fills it) and then, right before the click or request
   that writes, reads every one of those fields back from the site and
   compares it with the draft: a difference fails with
   `account_mismatch`, `target_mismatch` or `content_mismatch`, a field it
   cannot read with `account_unverified`, `target_unverified` or
   `content_unverified`, and nothing is sent. Only content the write sends
   from the draft itself (a Slack message's text in `chat.postMessage`, a
   Sheets paste's values) is not read back; `sites.drafts.get(id).checked`
   lists the fields a confirmation read back. A tool whose commit writes
   without reading back fails with `commit_unverified`, and
   `tests/browser-parity/sites/commit-protocol.test.mjs` enumerates every
   site method so that each write is a declared one that uses the protocol.
   Google's account is read from Google's account list (server state for
   the page's `/u/` index), read last, and counts only when the page's
   own chrome (its title suffix, its Google Account button outside the
   page's content) names that same account: page labels never stand in
   for it. Composer text (Gmail, LinkedIn, X) is read whole in the agent's
   isolated world, whitespace collapsed, Gmail's own signature and quoted
   text left out, so a composer that keeps the drafted opening and holds
   more fails. Every read-back runs in the agent's isolated world
   (`t.readBack`, or locators), never with `page.evaluate`, whose result
   is whatever the page's own `JSON.stringify`, `toJSON` or getters make
   of it, and the loader copies it once as plain data (strings, finite
   numbers, booleans, null, arrays and plain objects of them, data
   properties only) with built-ins captured when it loads: a bound field
   that is anything else counts as unread (`*_unverified`). A write that
   is a click (Gmail's Send, Calendar's Save, LinkedIn's and X's Post,
   Docs' and Slides' Replace all) presses only the element the commit
   pinned before its read-back: when the element can take the click and
   the pointer is on it, every field is read back and compared again, and
   the press is sent bound to that element (the driver's press check); a
   pinned element that left the document fails with `target_mismatch`, a
   change fails as at the first read-back, and nothing is pressed. A
   control the press opens (Calendar's invitation dialog Send) is pressed
   the same way (`press.next`): exactly one match, pinned, read back
   again. Every commit gives the loader an account reader (`{ account }`;
   a commit without one fails as `invalid` before it writes), and the
   loader reads the account once more as the last step before each write:
   before each press (Gmail's Send, Calendar's Save and invitation Send,
   LinkedIn's and X's Post, Drive's File > Move to trash, Docs' and
   Slides' Replace all), and before each batch of input or each request
   that is not a click (`press.input`: the Google editors' paste, typed
   cells, Delete, typed notes and typed append; Slack's
   `chat.postMessage`; Notion's `saveTransactions`; a WebMCP tool call).
   `press.input` can also take a reader of drafted fields that can move
   under the write (Sheets' append position): they are read and compared
   with the draft right before the batch, then the account, last. A check
   that fails after an earlier batch says that batch may have landed.
   A commit whose act writes without `press` or `press.input` fails as
   `commit_unverified`. A switch after the read-back fails with
   `account_mismatch` (`account_unverified` when the account cannot be
   read) and that write, and every later batch, is not sent; batches sent
   before it stay sent (Slides' Delete of the old notes before a typed
   line). The remaining window is between that last account read and the
   click or input reaching the page, which no site API closes: none binds
   a click or keystroke to an account. The request writes also bind the
   account in the request itself: Slack's `chat.postMessage` checks the
   member again in the same page call (`account_changed`); Notion reads
   and writes with `x-notion-active-user-header` set to the drafted user,
   so Notion runs the write as that user or refuses it, and its
   `saveTransactions` runs in the agent's isolated world under the
   fixed-origin guard, so the page's own `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest` or
   `JSON` never see or change it; a WebMCP call runs only in the listed
   document while the tool's descriptor is the previewed one
   (`page_changed`, `tool_changed`).
3. **Failures say what to do.** A tab that reaches a sign-in page (at load or
   later from script) fails with `not_signed_in` and names the fix; a CAPTCHA
   is reported, never solved; a wrong Google account is an HTTP 403 that names
   the `{ uid }` option.

Load order and the hook: `Resources/browser-repl/sites/loader.js` defines
`register` and `createSites`; each file in `sites/` registers one tool; the
files are in `manifest.json`'s `repl` list after `api.js`, which builds
`sites` on first use.

```js
// In one named session, so the draft survives until the user answers:
//   cmux browser repl --session mail
const hits = await sites.gmail.search("from:bob has:attachment newer_than:7d");
const thread = await sites.gmail.thread(hits[0].threadId);
const draft = await sites.gmail.send({ to: thread.messages[0].from.email, subject: "Re: " + thread.subject, body: "Thanks, looks good." });
draft.preview; // show it to the user; on approval:
await sites.gmail.send(draft.id, { confirm: true });
```

## Inventory

globals (reference A CLI 1.26.916); reference B is the Chrome plugin's `docs/`,
`docs/api.json` and `scripts/browser-service.mjs`. Read and write columns
name the method; "guide" means the reference only documents URLs and
shortcuts for the agent to drive by hand.

## Methods

Common options: Google tools take `uid` (the `/u/{uid}/` account index from
`sites.googleAccounts.list()`; a URL's `/u/N/` is used when present). Output
files go to `options.path`, else the session's temporary directory. Every
error is a `SiteError` with a `code`: `invalid`, `not_signed_in`,
`not_found`, `forbidden`, `timeout`, `captcha`, `consent_required`,
`no_captions`, `confirm_required`, `draft_required`, `draft_not_found`,
`draft_mismatch`, `draft_used`, `draft_expired`, `draft_changed`,
`account_mismatch`, `account_unverified`, `target_mismatch`,
`target_unverified`, `content_mismatch`, `content_unverified`,
`commit_unverified`, `reply_unverified`, `account_changed`, `account_unknown`, `tool_changed`,
`page_changed`, `origin_changed`, `write_requires_draft`, `unsupported`, `limit`.

| Method | Mechanism | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `googleAccounts.list()` | POST accounts.google.com/ListAccounts (cookie): `{ uid, id, name, email, signedOut }`, `id` Google's stable account id | read |
| `googleDocs.read(url, { format, uid })`, `.export(url, { format, path, uid })` | docs.google.com `/export?format=` (cookie) | read |
| `googleSheets.info(url)`, `.read(url, { gid, sheet, range })`, `.readAll(url)`, `.export(url, { format, gid })` | `/htmlview` for sheet names, `/export?format=csv&gid=` | read |
| `googleSlides.read(url)`, `.export(url, { format })` | `/export?format=` | read |
| `googleDrive.download(url)`, `.export(url, { kind, format })` | drive.usercontent.google.com `/download`, Docs export | read |
| `gmail.search(q, { limit, page, uid })`, `.inbox()`, `.thread(id, { format })`, `.attachment(id, name)` | Gmail web app in a background tab: thread rows (`tr.zA`), messages (`.adn`, expanded first); attachments are Gmail's attachment chips (`.aQH`, `.aZo`, never a link in the message body) whose link is Gmail's own `https://mail.google.com/mail/...view=att` URL, fetched with the session | read |
| `gmail.send({ to, cc, bcc, subject, body } \| { threadId, body, replyAll })` | draft; confirmed: Gmail compose (`?view=cm`) or the thread's Reply, the whole body checked in the composer, the To, Cc and Bcc rows (address chips and typed addresses, no chip outside them) checked against the draft, and for a new message the subject (`target_mismatch` or `content_mismatch` on any difference, `*_unverified` for a field it cannot read); a reply's rows are those its draft read from Gmail's reply composer, so a changed Reply-To or Cc sends nothing, and a reply composer whose To row cannot be read, or that holds a chip outside its rows, fails closed with `target_unverified` at the draft and at Send; `to`, `cc` and `bcc` cannot be set on a reply; confirmed replies are off in source (`reply_unverified`, nothing sent; the draft still shows the recipients) until a live check, drafts only, shows that the previewed To, Cc and Bcc are the ones Gmail's own reply composer addresses (decision 12); the page's account (Google's account list for its `/u/` index, which its title and account button must name) checked against the drafted account id and email, Send, wait for "Message sent" and the undo window | write [9], [14] |
| `googleCalendar.events({ date, view, query, limit })` | Calendar view or search in a background tab; each `[data-eventid]` and its screen-reader description | read |
| `googleCalendar.create({ title, start, end, allDay, description, location, guests, timeZone, recurrence })` | draft; confirmed: `calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE`, the event page's account checked as for Gmail, then the form checked against the draft right before Save (title exactly; start and end dates and times as shown, in `timeZone` or this Mac's (a named month, a year-first date, or a numeric date that reads only one way; a numeric date whose month and day could be either way round, such as `10/1/2026`, is not accepted); location and description with whitespace collapsed; the recurrence menu's words against the drafted rule: "Does not repeat" without one, else its frequency and interval, its weekdays (`BYDAY`) or day of the month (`BYMONTHDAY`, or one ordinal weekday such as `3TH`), the start's when the rule names none, the exact `COUNT` and the `UNTIL` date; a rule with any other part (`BYMONTH`, `BYSETPOS`, `WKST`, ...) is refused at the draft as `invalid`; the guests, organizer aside), failing with `target_mismatch` or `content_mismatch` (`*_unverified` for a field it cannot read) and saving nothing on any difference or a field it cannot read; Save, then, only when the draft has guests, the invitation dialog's Send, pressed like Save (the one Send in the dialog, pinned, after the form and account are read back again); the account is read once more, last, right before each of the two clicks | write [9], [14] |
| `googleSearch.search(q, options)` | the basic results page from the session's fetch (`/url?q=` links carry the destination), parsed in a blank tab; else the full page in a background tab (`div[data-rpos]` blocks, whose opaque `/goto` links are kept with `displayUrl`) | read |
| `youtube.search`, `.metadata`, `.captions`, `.comments` | desktop watch/results HTML (`ytInitialPlayerResponse`, `ytInitialData`, also as an escaped string), InnerTube `/youtubei/v1/next` | read |
| `youtube.transcript(v, { lang, timestamps, format })` | in order: InnerTube `/youtubei/v1/player` as the IOS, then ANDROID_VR client through the session's fetch (native clients' caption URLs need no player token; YouTube requires one for WEB subtitles, as yt-dlp's PO Token Guide documents), the track read as json3; the same calls from a youtube.com page; the watch page's track URL; last, the player in a muted background tab. A caption URL is fetched only when it is https on `www.youtube.com`, `m.youtube.com` or `youtube.com`, its path is `/api/timedtext` and its `v` is the requested video (track URLs come from page data); other tracks are skipped. A video with no track fails as `no_captions` | read |
| `slack.workspaces()`, `.channels`, `.history`, `.replies`, `.search`, `.user`, `.call(team, readMethod, params)` | Slack Web API from an app.slack.com tab, token from that page's `localStorage`; every page call runs under the fixed-origin guard (`withOrigin`) on `https://app.slack.com`, rechecks the document's origin before each request, and sends the token only to that fixed origin's `/api/` (the web client boots in a separate tab, which a redirect to sign-in or SSO cannot turn into a call target) | read |
| `slack.post({ team, channel, text, threadTs })` | draft with the workspace, member and channel ids and names; confirmed: the member and channel read back, the member once more, then one page call that runs `auth.test` with that workspace's token and, when it is the drafted member, `chat.postMessage` to those ids with the same token | write [9] |
| `notion.accounts()`, `.search(q, { spaceId })`, `.read(url)` | `/api/v3` (`getSpaces`, `search`, `loadPageChunk`, `syncRecordValues`) same-origin, on `app.notion.com`, else `www.notion.so`; `{ origin }` pins one of those two exactly and refuses any other | read |
| `notion.append(page, markdown, { userId })` | draft naming the Notion user; confirmed: `getSpaces` must still hold that user, then `syncRecordValues`, `getSpaces` once more, and `saveTransactions` (`set` and `listAfter` per block, after the last block) with `x-notion-active-user-header` set to that user, every call in the agent's isolated world | write [9] |
| `linkedin.me()`, `.profile(id)` | Voyager API same-origin, CSRF from the page's cookie | read |
| `linkedin.search(q, { type })`, `.feed()` | result and feed cards in a background tab | read |
| `linkedin.post({ text, audience })` | draft naming the member id and public identifier (account), and the member's profile URN (type `person`) and name the composer posts as and the audience, `"anyone"` (shown as `Anyone`) or `"connections"` (`Connections only`), which the call must name: a public post is an explicit choice, and a draft without it fails with `invalid` (target); confirmed: share composer (`/feed/?shareActive=true&text=`), the whole text checked, the member checked in that page (Voyager `/me`), the composer's header (`<name> Post to <audience>`, which keeps LinkedIn's last choice of identity and audience) checked, with the author URN on its actor (exactly one `fsd_profile`/`fs_miniProfile`/`fs_profile` URN, compared by id with the member's profile URN from `/me`, type `person`; company URNs map to type `organization`), so a post as a company page (even one with the member's name) or another member, or to another audience, fails with `target_mismatch`, and a header it cannot read, or without exactly one author URN, with `target_unverified`, then Post (the button itself, never the header) | write [9] |
| `x.user`, `.userTweets`, `.timeline`, `.search`, `.tweet` | profile and `article[data-testid="tweet"]` cards in a background tab, scrolled for more | read |
| `x.post(text \| { text, replyTo })` | draft naming the account X authenticates, by its immutable id (`id_str`) and its screen name, both from one `/i/api/1.1/account/verify_credentials.json` response (X's public web bearer token and the `ct0` CSRF value; no draft, `account_unknown`, without both); confirmed: Web Intent `/intent/post`, the whole text checked, the id and screen name asked again from that page and once more right before Post, so another account that took the screen name fails with `account_mismatch`, Post | write [9] |
| `github.issue`, `.pull`, `.issues` | pages in a background tab | read |
| `github.assigned({ issues, pulls, state, limit })` | GitHub's own search (`/search?type=issues`, `assignee:@me`) answering JSON in the session, 10 per page | read |
| `googleDrive.recent({ uid, limit })` | Drive's Recent view in a background tab, rows by `data-id` | read |
| `github.diff`, `.file` | `/pull/N.diff`, `/raw/REF/PATH` with the session | read |
| GitHub repository names | `owner/repo` components are single path segments (letters, digits, `_`, `-`, `.`), never `.` or `..`, nothing encoded; `.file` paths and refs refuse empty, `.` and `..` segments; every issue, pull, diff, list and raw URL must still start with `https://github.com/owner/repo/` once parsed, else `invalid` before any request | read |
| `linear.*` | client-api.linear.app GraphQL from a linear.app tab with the session | read |
| `linear.query(text, variables, { operationName })` | the same; the document is first lexed and parsed as GraphQL (comments, commas, strings and block strings skipped). It is refused, with nothing sent, when it does not parse, holds a mutation or subscription anywhere, or holds several operations without an `operationName` naming one | read |
| `jira.*` | `/rest/api/3/issue`, `/search/jql` (falls back to `/search`), `/myself`, same-origin, only on a site whose exact origin is in the signed-in account's `jira.sites()` list (read once per session, again when a site is missing); any other `*.atlassian.net` site fails as `invalid` before a request.

## Editing Google files

Specialized tools for Google Sheets, Docs and Slides, covering reference C's
Google Sheets actions (`read_sheet_contents`, `read_cell_contents`,
`update_cell_contents`, `clear_cell_contents`, `select_cell_or_range`,
`fallback_input_into_single_selected_cell`; commented out in its current
tree) and more. Reference C reads by copying the selection to the system
clipboard and writes by dispatching a synthetic paste event; cmux reads
through the editors' own exports (no selection, no clipboard, whole files
and every tab) and writes with real input into a background tab, then reads
the file back to verify.

| Method | Mechanism | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `googleSheets.info(url)` | `/htmlview` tab list | read |
| `googleSheets.read(url, { gid, sheet, range })` | CSV export: values | read |
| `googleSheets.cells(url, { sheet, gid, range })` | xlsx export unzipped in a docs.google.com page (`DecompressionStream`): `{ cell, value, formula }` | read |
| `googleSheets.find(url, text)` | the same, every tab | read |
| `googleSheets.write(url, range, rows)` | name box selects the top-left cell, then one Meta+V of the rows as TSV from the tab's clipboard (a trusted `paste` whose `clipboardData` Sheets reads; `=` makes a formula); if the export does not show the values within about 5 s, each value is typed with real keys (Tab between cells, Enter after a row). A value with a tab, LF, CR, U+2028, U+2029 or U+0085 fails with `invalid` before any draft (Sheets' paste parser ends a cell at a tab and a row at LF, CR or CRLF; the three Unicode line terminators are refused the same way). Verified through the xlsx export of the range plus one more row and column: a cell outside the confirmed range that changed after the write fails with `commit_unverified` (naming the cells) and nothing more is typed | write |
| `googleSheets.append(url, rows)` | the same after the last non-empty row. The draft binds the append position (`appendAt`, the first empty row after the data, a target field). The CSV export is read again at the confirmation and right before each input batch (the paste, and each typed row of the fallback, which allows the rows this write typed already); the write fails with `target_mismatch` and sends nothing more when the data no longer ends at the drafted row or a row other than this write's follows it, so rows added meanwhile are never overwritten. The web editor has no insert-at-end the session can call; the remaining windows are an edit made between that last read and the input reaching the page, and an edit that the export does not show yet when it is read | write |
| `googleSheets.clear(url, range)` | name box selects the range, Delete, verified | write |
| `googleDocs.structure(url)` | HTML export parsed in a blank tab: headings with levels, paragraphs, lists, tables | read |
| `googleDocs.replace(url, find, replacement)` | Find and replace (Meta+Shift+H), Replace all, verified through the text export. The draft states the match count and offsets in the text export (case ignored, as Find and replace matches by default); the draft also shows the text's hash; right before Replace all the export is read again and the write fails (`content_mismatch`) unless the count, offsets and hash are the same, so a match added since the preview is never edited | write |
| `googleDocs.insertAfter(url, anchor, text)` | the same with `anchor` -> `anchor + text`; the anchor must occur exactly once, also with case ignored (as Find and replace matches). The draft shows the match count (1) and its offset in the text export; right before Replace all the export is read again and the write fails (`content_mismatch`) unless it is the same text (its hash), so a second match or another change is never edited (an edit not yet saved to the export when it is read is the remaining window) | write |
| `googleDocs.append(url, text)` | end of document (Meta+ArrowDown), Enter, typed text, verified | write |
| `googleSlides.slides(url)` | pptx export: `{ index, title, text, notes }` per slide | read |
| `googleSlides.setNotes(url, slide, text)` | the slide's filmstrip thumbnail (`g#filmstrip-slide-<n>-<page>`); the draft names the slide by its object id (`<page>`), its title and its position, read from one consistent view of the deck (the filmstrip's object ids read before and after the pptx export must agree, else `target_unverified`), and the write reads all three again and fails with `target_mismatch` when the slide moved or was deleted; the speaker notes box, old notes selected (Meta+ArrowUp, Meta+Shift+ArrowDown) and deleted, new notes typed; verified through the pptx export | write |
| `googleSlides.replace(url, find, replacement)` | Find and replace, verified through the pptx export. The draft states the match count per slide (slide text and notes, case ignored); the draft also shows the deck's hash; right before Replace all the pptx export is read again and the write fails (`content_mismatch`) unless the deck is unchanged | write |
| `googleDrive.create(kind, title, { uid })` | `docs.google.com/<kind>/create?authuser=<email>`, with the email of the account at `/u/<uid>/` (default 0) read first, so a sign-in by another session that moves accounts to other indexes cannot put the file in another account; then the title field. Returns `account` | creates a private file |
| `googleDrive.trash(url)` | the editor's File > Move to trash, after the sharing check below | delete |

The xlsx and pptx exports (`googleSheets.cells`, `googleSheets.find`,
`googleSlides.slides`, and the reads before and after their writes) come
from a file that another person can share, so the reader bounds the ZIP
before it unzips it in a blank page. An export of more than 10,000
entries fails with `limit`. Every header, name and data range must lie
inside the archive, else the read fails with `unexpected` (also for an
encrypted entry or a compression method other than stored or deflate).
A wanted entry that declares more than 64 MiB uncompressed, or wanted
entries that together declare more than 64 MiB (the size of one driver
result, which carries the text back), fail with `limit` before anything
is decompressed. Compressed data goes into `DecompressionStream` 16 KiB at
a time, so one output burst is at most about 16.5 MiB, and the stream is
cancelled with `limit` as soon as an entry's output passes its declared
size. An entry whose output is shorter than its declared size fails with
`unexpected`. So a high-ratio export or a header that lies about its size
never decompresses more than 64 MiB.

Rule for writes (reference B's confirmation taxonomy, [9] edits others can see):
every write is a draft, also on a file whose Share button says "Private
to only me": the label is page text, so it never decides that an edit can
skip the confirmation. The draft opens the file's editor and shows the
file id, its title, the Share button's label, the account the editor acts
as (Google's account id and email; see the draft protocol above) and the
change. The label is read only from the editor's own Share button (the
one element with its id, in the editor's header) and the labels inside
it, which must agree; a sharing label anywhere else in the page counts for
nothing, and a second, different one in the button makes the sharing
unknown, which drafts nothing (`target_unverified`). The confirmed draft
opens the editor again and reads the file, title, sharing and account back
right before its first input, failing with `target_mismatch` or
`account_mismatch` and changing nothing when one differs (a file shared
since the preview, an account signed in at its `/u/` index). A sharing or
account change during the input itself is the remaining window.
`googleDrive.trash` deletes data ([1]) and is a draft the same way, also
for a file `googleDrive.create` made in the same session.

## Confirmation taxonomy

Reference B's `docs/confirmations.md` sorts browser actions into
"hand-off required", "always confirm at action time", "pre-approval works"
and "no confirmation". Every cmux write is in "always confirm": [9]
representational communication (mail, messages, posts, events, page edits)
and [14] transmitting data to a third party. Each draft names its category.
cmux has no delete, share, permission, purchase or account-creation tool;
those stay with the agent driving the page under the policy, and are listed
as decisions below. `{ confirm: true }` is the agent's statement that the
user approved this exact preview; the API cannot see the user, so it makes
the preview and the second call unavoidable and makes approval impossible to
skip by accident.

### WebMCP calls

A page writes its WebMCP tools' annotations, so `readOnlyHint` is advisory: a
page can mark a tool that changes or sends data as read-only.
`sites.webmcp.call(name, input)` therefore returns a draft for every tool,
whatever it declares, and only `call(draftId, { confirm: true })` runs it.
The agent can skip the draft for one call with
`call(name, input, { trustReadOnlyHint: true })`, which runs the tool at once
only when it declares `readOnlyHint`; any other tool still returns a draft.
That option is the agent's statement that it accepts the page's claim for
this call. A name the page does not list fails as `not_found` and is not run.
The draft binds the tool's descriptor (name, title, description, input
schema and annotations as sorted-key JSON): its preview shows the schema,
the annotations and a hash of the descriptor, and the confirmed call passes
the descriptor into the page call, which runs the tool only when the page
lists it with that same descriptor, else fails with `tool_changed`. Every
call, a confirmed draft or a `trustReadOnlyHint` one, runs only in the
document and at the URL its tool was listed in: the listing takes an
element handle of the document's root (handles live in cmux's agent world
and resolve only in the document that issued them, so the page cannot copy
or forge the binding) and notes the URL before it lists; the page call runs
through that handle, so a new document fails it before anything runs, and
it checks the root and URL first and again right before the tool runs, else
fails with `page_changed` and calls nothing (a reload, a navigation, or a
`pushState` since the listing). A page
that keeps the descriptor and swaps the implementation behind it is not
detected: the page owns its tools' code, so a WebMCP preview describes what
the page declares, never what its code does.

## Secure sign-in

`sites.browserAuth.request({ origin, fields, submit })` checks that each
selector is one visible, enabled credential field (a password input, or a
username or one-time-code input by type, `autocomplete` or name; a
requested password only into a password input) in the tab's origin and that
all are in one frame, marks them with a random attribute, and calls the
driver's `auth.request`. It asks only in a tab the session opened
(`tabs.open`), under a domain policy that keeps the session's tabs on the
page's exact host and port with https (`session.allowedDomains(["https://accounts.example.com:443"])`
for a sign-in on `accounts.example.com`, `:8443` for one on that port; a
loopback host also on http, `localhost:3000`). A policy without the port
is not enough, since it lets the host's other ports load: a value typed
for `:8443` would reach a service on `:9443` (decided 2026-10-06, r25). A
wildcard over the site, such as `*.example.com`, is not enough: a sibling
host of the same site could receive the values. On a two-label host the
policy names it in the exact-host form, `session.allowedDomains(["=https://example.com:443"])`,
since `https://example.com` also lets `www.example.com` load; the
credential's domain takes that form too, so the native matcher, the
content rules and the frame checks leave out the www host (decided
2026-10-06). The session refuses the
call otherwise (the error names the pattern to allow), sends that host to
the driver as the credential's domains, and from then on refuses a policy
that reaches past it, as for a typed secret; the driver refuses a frame
outside it. The app shows a sheet on the browser
pane's window naming the origin of the frame that holds the fields, from
WebKit's record of it (and the page's origin when the frame is embedded from
another), with one field per request (secure text for passwords), labeled
by the credential kind the app found on the bound element (username or
email, password, one-time code). Nothing on the sheet is text the page or
the agent chose: not the tab title, not the agent's `label`. Before the sheet shows, the
app runs `sites/auth-fill.js` in its own content world of that frame, which
agent code cannot script, to bind the request: it keeps the one element
that holds each marker, and the frame's document, there. On Fill the same
script writes only into those elements, and only while the frame still
shows that document, each element is still in it and still the only one
with its marker (otherwise `page_changed`, nothing filled), so another
session driving the tab, or the page, cannot move the fill to another
element or another document of the same origin while the user types.
Agent code can call `auth.request` itself, so the helper's checks are not
the guard: the app's bind and fill take only a field the user can see
(shown, with no `display: none`, `opacity: 0` on it or an ancestor,
`visibility` other than visible or `inert`, and at least 4 CSS pixels each
way), and at fill time one that takes focus and, scrolled into view by it,
is on screen and is what the frame's hit test finds at the middle of its
visible part (not covered); a field that fails is `locator_invalid` and
gets nothing. It checks the credential rule again, sets each value
with the native setter and dispatches `input` and `change`, so
framework-controlled fields see it. `submit` is pressed after the fill
only when it is the submit control of the form that holds the fields (a
submit button or input of that form with `action: "click"`, or one of the
fields with `action: "press_enter"`), checked before the sheet opens
(`locator_invalid` with `field_id: "submit"`, no sheet) and again right
before the press (`submission_failed`); the agent cannot have cmux press
another control in the user's name. The REPL receives only a status:
`submitted`, `cancelled`, `unavailable`, `expired`, `origin_changed`,
`page_changed`, `locator_invalid` (`not_credential_field` among the reasons)
or `submission_failed`. The fill script is read from the signed app bundle,
never from the REPL, so an agent cannot substitute code that receives the
values. Right before the fill the app records each non-empty value as a
typed secret of the tab with no typing session
(`BrowserReplTypedSecrets.recordCredential`): every session that reads the
tab, the asking one included, gets it masked as
`<secret:browserAuth.<field id>>` in results, events, files and output,
and capture masks hide it in screenshots and PDFs, until the tab closes.
The masking matches values, so agent code that transforms a field's value
in the page before returning it is the remaining limit, as for typed
secrets. The sheet says what holds: cmux masks what the user types in what
the agent reads back, and the page's scripts can read a filled field. Under a domain policy the driver refuses the request
(`blocked`) when the tab's page, or the frame that holds the fields (by
WebKit's record of it and by the document it shows when the request
arrives), is on a domain the policy blocks. The sheet lasts only as long as
the call that asked: when that call is cancelled (its cell is cancelled or
times out, the session is reset, closes or idles out), the sheet goes away
with what was typed in it and the request ends `cancelled`, and after Fill
nothing is filled unless the session still runs and is the live creator of
the tab, whose REPL state and web view are the ones the request was made
for, and its domain policy is still the one the request was allowed under
(a policy or directory change while the sheet is up, even before its rules
reach the tab, ends the request) and still allows the tab's page. The app
checks that in the same main-thread turn that hands WebKit the fill script,
so a detach, reset or policy change before that turn fills nothing
(`cancelled`).

## Decisions for the user

These are not implemented and need a decision:

1. **CAPTCHA solving.** Reference A solves by clicking, dragging and OCR; reference B's
   policy requires confirmation at action time. cmux reports `captcha` and
   stops.
2. **Third-party password managers.** Reading or autofilling 1Password,
   Bitwarden, Dashlane, LastPass, Proton Pass or Apple Passwords puts vault
   access behind an agent. `browserAuth` covers sign-in without it.
3. **iMessage, SMS and KakaoTalk.** Not browser operations; they read local
   message databases and send as the user.
4. **Image generation and image search.** Not browser operations; image
   generation needs an API credential.
5. **Bot-detection evasion.** Not implemented; reference B's `botDetection` is
   telemetry, and cmux does not disguise automation.
6. **Google Docs and Sheets editing.** Reference A edits by clipboard paste and
   index-mapped selection. A cmux version would be a draft of the diff,
   confirmed, applied with real input in the document tab.
7. **More social writes.** LinkedIn messages and invitations, X likes,
   follows, reposts and DMs: each is [9] or [14]; the draft mechanism supports
   them, but each adds a way to act as the user in public.
8. **Native approval for writes.** A cmux sheet showing the draft, with
   Send and Cancel, would make approval the user's click instead of the
   agent's `{ confirm: true }`.
9. **Sign-in method choice and QR codes** in `browserAuth` (reference B's
   `options` and `qr_code`).
10. **Contacts.** Reference A's `googlePeople` reads the user's address book; cmux
    has no contacts tool.
11. **Reference A's own platform.** `referenceA.settings`, `projects`, `routines` and
    `channels` manage reference A, not a browser; the cmux counterparts are app
    settings and workspaces.
12. **Gmail replies.** A reply draft shows the To, Cc and Bcc read from
    Gmail's reply composer, and the confirmation reads them back right
    before Send, but the composer markup it reads has only mock coverage.
    Confirmed replies stay off (`REPLIES_VERIFIED` in `sites/gmail.js`)
    until a live check on a signed-in profile, drafts only, shows the
    previewed recipients equal Gmail's for Reply, Reply all and a sender's
    Reply-To.

`tests/browser-parity/capabilities.json` (`sites`) maps every reference A site
global and method and every reference B site capability
(`reference/site-surface.txt`) to its `sites.*` or `tabs.*` equivalent and the
tests that prove it, or to one of these decisions; the capabilities unit test
fails on an unmapped member.

## Tests

Live-site status: the site tools are not yet tested against the real sites
with signed-in accounts. Every write checks the page it acts on (signed-in
account, author or account id, audience, origin and the confirmed fields)
and fails closed with `target_unverified`, `target_mismatch` or
`account_unverified` when the real page differs from what the tool expects.
A tool that meets an unknown page layout therefore refuses the write; it
does not guess.

`tests/browser-parity/sites/` runs every tool on the Playwright WebKit dev
driver against `mock-sites.mjs`: one handler per host that answers the
endpoints and page structure each tool relies on, with shapes from each
site's public documentation or public pages and synthetic data. Real hosts
are routed to the mock in the browser and in the REPL's `fetch`; any other
https request is blocked. Each host checks the session the way the site does,
so the tests prove the tools use the session, keep secrets in the page (the
REPL scope is scanned for them), write only after a confirmed draft, and
report sign-in pages. `commit-protocol.test.mjs` lists every site method:
each must be a declared write (`register(name, factory, { writes })`) whose
confirmed draft reads every bound field back, or a read or local action
listed there.

```sh
node --test tests/browser-parity/sites/*.test.mjs
tests/browser-parity/gate.sh   # includes it
```

Live smoke checklist, read-only and public pages only, run once on a tagged
app build:

1. `await sites.youtube.search("rick astley never gonna give you up", { limit: 3 })`
2. `await sites.youtube.metadata("dQw4w9WgXcQ")` and `.captions(...)`
3. `(await sites.youtube.transcript("dQw4w9WgXcQ", { timestamps: true })).slice(0, 200)`
4. `(await sites.youtube.comments("dQw4w9WgXcQ", { limit: 3 })).comments.length`
5. `await sites.googleSearch.search("webkit content world", { limit: 3 })`
6. `await sites.github.issue("https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/1")`
7. `(await sites.github.diff("https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/1")).slice(0, 200)`
8. On `https://example.com`: `await sites.pageAssets.list()` and `await sites.webmcp.tools()`

Result of that run on `brepl-sites1` (commit be5988f070e): every item
returned real data. It found three things the first mocks did not model,
now in the mocks and fixed: the REPL's fetch gets YouTube's mobile site and
Google's basic results page, a tab gets Google's opaque `/goto` links, and
YouTube's player token makes the direct caption URL empty.

Transcript reliability, 3 public videos (manual English captions
`dQw4w9WgXcQ`, auto-generated Korean only `9bZkp7q19f0`, Spanish with
`{ lang: "es" }` `kJQP7kiw5Fk`): reference A `youtube.getTranscript` 15/15 (5 runs
each, about 200 ms); cmux with the native-client path 30/30 (10 runs each,
about 300 ms), same text lengths as reference A. Reference B's
`exportYouTubeTranscript` was not measured: its reference client may open
only the approved loopback origin.

`live-diff.mjs` compares the reads live, on the user's own sign-ins, with
reference A: `signed-in` reports which sites each side is signed in to (cookie
names on cmux, account counts on reference A, no content); `run [--ops a,b]
[--runs N] [--write-doc]` runs each read on both sides and keeps only
summaries (counts, sha256-prefixed ids, key names, lengths, order agreement,
latency) in the gitignored `sites/live-results/`, with the verdict per read.

Tools against private accounts (Gmail, Calendar, Slack, Notion, LinkedIn, X
timelines, Linear, Jira) are verified only against the mocks: running them
live reads the user's private data. Their page selectors follow the sites'
current markup and will need updates when the sites change it; each such
failure is a `timeout` naming what it waited for.
