# Concepts

## Tree

The mux tree is:

```text
session -> workspaces -> screens -> split-tree panes -> tabs
```

A session is one mux backend and one control socket. A workspace owns zero or more screens. A screen is the layout selected in the status bar. A normal screen owns one binary split tree whose leaves are panes. A horizontally scrollable screen owns an ordered list of stable columns, and each column owns its own split tree. The server projects those columns into the existing split-tree protocol shape for compatibility. A pane owns an ordered list of tab placements. A PTY tab projects a session-owned terminal resource, and several tabs may project the same terminal. A browser tab owns one single-view browser surface. The raw protocol's legacy `surface` ID identifies the tab placement.

Protocol v8 assigns each interior split node a stable `SplitId`. Frontends use it as divider identity and resize that exact node with `set-split-ratio`. The id survives ratio, focus, tab, and leaf-order changes. It disappears only when its node collapses.

The UI uses tmux-style verbs for screens. Prefix `c` creates a screen, prefix `n` and `p` switch screens, prefix `&` closes a screen, and prefix `,` renames a screen. PTY tabs use prefix `t`, tab chips, and tab context menus.

## Active and Focus State

The shared compatibility tree records default active workspace, screen, pane, and tab values. A frontend may use them for initial placement or a deliberately shared projection, but they are not global user focus. Each frontend keeps its current workspace, screen, pane, tab, text selection, scroll position, crop, pan, hover, drag, and key-prefix state in client memory. Focusing or selecting in one frontend therefore does not move another frontend's focus or viewport. Legacy focus commands update the compatibility defaults for clients that explicitly use them.

The compatibility tree's pane-focus metadata tracks recent activity. When closing its active pane or the last tab in it, mux chooses the most recently active remaining pane on that screen instead of always choosing a neighbor.

Notifications mark the tab that raised them as unread. The marker belongs
to the tab's content, so every view of one terminal shows it. Frontends clear
it with an explicit acknowledgement when the user has seen the tab, not by
moving focus, and the acknowledgement is durable across restarts.

## Frontend Projections

The workspace tree is one durable shared backend projection. Frontends may also store opaque schema-versioned documents with `put-frontend-projection`: `personal` scope belongs to one stable user, profile, or device subject, while `shared` scope belongs to a collaboration view. Either document may place one terminal UUID several times and may deliberately save focus or viewport preferences. Unsaved focus, selection, scroll, crop, pan, hover, drag, and key-prefix state remain client-local. A projection owns presentation only; removing it never closes a terminal.

## Workspace Groups

The sidebar can group workspaces into ordered, named sections. Groups are
shared durable state in the session registry, like workspace names and order,
so every frontend shows the same groups after a restart. A group's collapsed
flag is shared too. Groups partition the one workspace order instead of
keeping their own member lists: a section shows its workspaces in workspace
order, and moving a workspace inside a section reorders the workspace list
around the other members. Deleting a group ungroups its workspaces in place.

A workspace can also carry a shared color, an SF Symbol icon, and a custom
title that frontends show instead of its name. These are durable like the
name and are not per-window preferences.

## Tabs and Names

A terminal resource wraps one child process connected to one pseudo-terminal, its ordered input and output, retained history, canonical grid, and graphics state. A PTY tab is a named view placement of that resource. A browser tab wraps one local Chrome/Chromium target and cannot have a second placement.

`rename-tab` sets the placement-local name. Empty tab names clear the custom name and fall back to the generated tab label. The old config key `rename-pane` is still accepted as an alias for the `rename-tab` key binding, but the UI rename action targets the tab placement, not the pane object.

A tab placement can be pinned. Pinned tabs sort first in their pane for
every frontend, and the flag follows the tab across panes and restarts. Each
PTY tab also reports its working directory and the git branch of the
repository containing it, read on the machine that runs the terminal.

Tabs in one pane can form tab groups: a name (possibly empty),
one of nine colors, and a shared collapsed flag. Members are contiguous in
the strip, pinned tabs cannot join, and a whole group moves as one: within a
strip, to another pane, or into a new split, column, or workspace. A saved
group is a session-wide record of a group's name, color, and members that
outlives its tabs; reopening it reattaches terminals that are still running
and starts new ones in the saved directories.

Pane names still exist in the control socket through `rename-pane`. They are separate from the tab labels shown in the TUI.

## Automatic Layout

The modeless `Alt-n` binding creates a new pane and reapplies Zellij's default distribution inside the focused horizontal column. Each column preserves its own pane creation order across swaps and manual splits. A screen without horizontal columns is one implicit column, so the default behavior is unchanged.

## Viewport Panes

`Ctrl-b g` creates a terminal immediately after the horizontal column containing the focused pane. Its default width is two-thirds of each frontend's viewport. Supporting frontends retain each column's independent width and expose overflow through a horizontal scrollbar. Ordinary split and startup behavior remain tiled.

## Layout Undo

Each screen keeps an in-memory history of its latest structural layout actions. `Ctrl-b U` undoes the newest entry on the focused screen. Repeated changes to one divider are coalesced. Undoing pane creation requires confirmation because it removes the pane's tab placements and closes single-view browser surfaces. PTY terminal resources remain session-owned. The confirmation carries the exact layout revision, so a later layout action makes an older prompt fail without changing anything. A direct pane close clears the history because the journal cannot reconstruct exact removed tab membership or a closed browser target.

Tab drags are single commands. Dropping a tab on a pane edge, between
columns, on another pane's tab strip, or on the sidebar moves the existing
placement in one commit, so the terminal never restarts. A drag that stays on
one screen and keeps its source pane is one layout-undo entry; undo moves the
tab back instead of closing the pane it created.

## Collapse Behavior

Closing a tab removes one placement. A PTY terminal remains addressable with zero or more placements. An owner started with `--terminal-reap-grace-seconds <n>` (or `cmux daemon ensure --terminal-reap-grace-seconds <n>`) ends a terminal that has had zero placements for `n` seconds (0 ends it at once); without the option no terminal is reaped. The reaper skips a terminal that is marked kept (`set-terminal-keep`, `keep` on `new-tab`/`split`/`create-terminal`, or `cmux terminal <term_id> keep on`). A placement restored within the grace period, such as a layout undo, cancels the reap, and a restart of the owner starts the grace period again. `terminal.close` ends a terminal at once. A browser closes with its only tab. If the pane still has tabs, the active tab index moves to a remaining tab.

If a pane loses its last tab, that pane is removed from the split tree and its parent split collapses to the remaining child. If that empties the screen, the screen is removed. A canonical workspace remains in the durable registry when its final screen or terminal view disappears; it becomes an empty workspace and is still projected to every frontend. Only an explicit `close-workspace` mutation tombstones it. If every workspace is explicitly closed, mux emits an `empty` event.

Closing a pane removes all tab placements in that pane. Closing a screen removes every pane and placement in that screen. Closing a workspace tombstones that workspace and removes all of its placements. These tree operations detach PTY terminal views without ending their processes at once; a detached terminal that is not kept is reaped after the grace period. Browser surfaces close because they are single-view. With `end_terminals` (capability `batch-close-v1`), `close-pane`, `close-screen`, `close-workspace`, and `close-tab-group` also end, in the same durable commit, every terminal whose views all closed and that is not kept. `close-tabs` closes any set of tabs in one commit, with the same option.

## PTY and Browser Surfaces

A terminal runtime parses child-process output once with libghostty-vt. Every PTY tab or attached frontend renders a view of that shared terminal state while keeping its own selection, scroll offset, crop, pan, and scale. Inline Kitty image storage, aliases, quota, cell pixels, and placement anchors belong to the terminal runtime rather than any one view. Attach clients receive a VT replay first, then a base64 stream of subsequent PTY bytes, plus ordered resize frames when canonical geometry changes. Graphics survive projection, attach, remote mirroring, scrolling, and resize within the configured replay and transport byte limits; graphics beyond the replay budget may be omitted.

A frontend-rendered browser tab is a browser placement whose page a native
frontend draws with WebKit or CEF. The daemon stores its URL, title, favicon,
engine, and profile so the tab restores with the tree, but it never attaches
a CDP target or renders frames for it; the frontend reports navigation back.

A browser surface is a local Chrome/Chromium target controlled through the Chrome DevTools Protocol. The local TUI draws browser frames with kitty graphics and forwards keyboard, mouse, and wheel input over CDP. Protocol-v7 attach clients receive an initial `browser-state` event with the latest optional frame, followed by updated `browser-state` and base64 PNG `frame` events.
