//! Roles that `cmux host run` supervises beside the session host (lane 1
//! vm-image.md 6.3; server.md 3). Owned by lane 10 after this revision.
//!
//! The supervisor (crate `cmux-host`) owns clone detection, the bind
//! sequence, re-keying and process supervision. A role is a unit of
//! machine software (the store updater, Postgres, app servers, …) that
//! reacts to the supervisor's lifecycle.
//!
//! # Order
//!
//! The supervisor starts roles in `Vec` order and delivers `Bound`,
//! `Resumed`, `AddressesChanged`, `ChannelChanged` and `ConfigChanged` in
//! that order. It delivers `Parked` and `Shutdown`, and calls
//! [`Role::stop`], in reverse order, so a role may rely on every role
//! before it while it runs and while it stops. There is no dependency graph.
//!
//! # Blocking contract
//!
//! [`Role::start`] and [`Role::on_event`] for every event except `Parked`
//! and `Shutdown` must not block: the supervisor's single event loop has to
//! stay responsive to the next clone signal. A role that needs I/O starts
//! it and returns.
//!
//! `on_event(Parked)`, `on_event(Shutdown)` and [`Role::stop`] may block,
//! but only until the deadline the supervisor passes in (in the event and
//! in [`StopContext`]). Postgres runs `pg_ctl stop -w` there before a
//! snapshot; app servers drain. A role that cannot finish by the deadline
//! returns `Err`: for `Parked` the supervisor then refuses the park (the
//! session host keeps running, so the bake's park step fails instead of
//! snapshotting a half-stopped machine) and starts every role again.
//!
//! # Rebind
//!
//! When a running machine finds a new instance id (a fork of a running
//! machine, or a clone whose session host crashed), the supervisor calls
//! [`Role::stop`] on every role, in reverse order and with no event,
//! before it replaces the identity. No role hears an event while the id
//! changes. When the bind commits, it starts every role again with the
//! new id ([`RoleContext::instance_id`]) and then delivers `Bound`. If the
//! bind fails, the roles stay stopped (as the session host does) until a
//! later bind commits. A clone of a parked snapshot has no running roles,
//! so there it is only start, then `Bound`.
//!
//! # Failures
//!
//! A role error is never fatal. The supervisor logs it and reports the
//! latest one per role in `cmux host status --json` as
//! `roles[].last_error`. [`Role::stop`] is called after a failed
//! [`Role::start`] too and must be safe then. [`Role::start`] may be called
//! again after a `stop` (a refused park, a rebind).
