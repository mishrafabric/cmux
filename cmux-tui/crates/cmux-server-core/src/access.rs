//! Required owners and permissions of the server's directories, as data
//! (server.md 4.3, 7.4, 8.2).
//!
//! The I/O crate creates each path with this access and checks it again at
//! every start. When an existing path has another owner, wider permissions,
//! an extra ACL entry, or is a symlink where `no_symlink` is set, the server
//! refuses to start and reports the path; it never repairs it silently,
//! because a wrong owner on a shared directory (`/tmp`, `%ProgramData%`)
//! means someone else created it first.
//!
//! One rule for modes (decision SV-R4): an existing directory is never
//! changed. A policy path is refused when it is wider than its mode;
//! narrower is accepted. 0700 is required only on the folders the server
//! creates for secrets and state (the state directory, the socket
//! directories); a store root holds only signed public packages and needs
//! no more than "not writable by others" (0755).
