//! The `acpmux` command line: `entry` is the program (the `acpmux` binary
//! and `cmux acp` both call it); `command` is the argument grammar; `run`
//! dispatches a parsed command; `output` formats what the daemon answers;
//! `orchestrate` holds the commands other agents and scripts call; `handoff`
//! is `continue`; `errors` maps every failure to one exit code and envelope.
