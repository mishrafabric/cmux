//! The bind agent's decision logic as a pure state machine
//! (vm-image.md 6.2-6.4).
//!
//! Inputs are wake events and observations (one metadata read plus the
//! bound and bake files); outputs are [`Action`]s in the order the agent
//! must run them. Nothing here reads a clock, a file or the network, so
//! every rule has a unit or property test (`tests/machine_props.rs`).
//!
//! Rules:
//! - A new instance id (not the bake id, not the bound id) binds exactly
//!   once: reseed the CRNG, mark the clone started, drop inherited remote
//!   identity, write the bound id (one guarded group: the first failure
//!   stops the bind, nothing spawns, and a bounded retry follows), then
//!   spawn the session host and run the off-critical-path work (announce,
//!   re-key, prompt sync, timer re-arm).
//! - A bound session host from another machine (a fork of a running
//!   machine) is stopped before its identity is dropped; the bind resumes
//!   when it has exited.
//! - The bake id parks: session host stopped, then terminal hosts stopped
//!   (the warm template terminal is kept by the agent), housekeeping timers
//!   stopped, and no spawn until a new id or an unpark.
//! - Roles never run while the identity changes: a bind stops them first,
//!   they hear no event (no `Resumed`) and no announce runs until the bind
//!   commits, and they start again with the new id, then hear `Bound`. A
//!   failed bind leaves them stopped with the session host.
//! - No instance id never binds. Without any metadata service (a
//!   container) the session host runs with the identity it has. On a
//!   machine with one, a failed read never spawns; when parked, with no
//!   session host, or after a clone signal (clock set, driver file: a
//!   fork may have happened) it arms a bounded retry (50 ms doubling, 10
//!   times), and `Resumed` waits for a read that confirms the id.
//! - Every restart goes through a fresh observation (a backoff timer can
//!   be from before a snapshot). Session host exits restart with a capped
//!   backoff
//!   ([`crate::retry::backoff_delay_ms`]); a host that lived at least
//!   [`HEALTHY_RUN_MS`] resets the backoff.
