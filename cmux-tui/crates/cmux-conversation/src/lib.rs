//! The conversation owner's pure reducer (plans/cmux-next/home.md sections 1
//! and 2, capability `local-conversations-v1`).
//!
//! This crate holds the wire types and the validation of every conversation
//! op. It has no I/O, no clock and no randomness: the host passes `now`, new
//! ids and the stored rows an op needs, and persists what [`apply`] returns.
//! The local owner (the cmux daemon) and the cloud owner (`ConversationDO`)
//! run the same reducer, so both speak the same ops and events.
