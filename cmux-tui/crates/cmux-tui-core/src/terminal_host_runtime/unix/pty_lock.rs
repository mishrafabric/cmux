//! The PTY ownership fence of one terminal incarnation (cx-6so.49 L1).
//!
//! With PTY custody, the owner holds a copy of a host's PTY master and can
//! start a replacement host on it. Two hosts must never serve the same
//! incarnation: both would read the PTY and split its bytes. Every host
//! therefore holds an exclusive kernel lock on
//! `<root>/<terminal id>.<incarnation>.pty.lock` for its whole process
//! lifetime, taken before it touches a PTY or publishes anything. The kernel
//! releases it only when the holder process is really gone, so a stopped
//! (`SIGSTOP`) host still holds it and is never replaced.
//!
//! The file is removed only by a remover that itself holds the lock (so no
//! live host loses its fence), and an acquirer that finds its locked file
//! unlinked or replaced retries on the new file.
