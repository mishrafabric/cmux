//! The contract of `cmux link`, the per-user process that owns this machine's
//! overlay endpoint (plans/cmux-next/transport.md sections 3 and 12a).
//!
//! Pure pieces shared by the link agent, the session daemon's remote entry
//! and the dial provider in `cmux-remote`:
//!
//! - [`stamp`]: the verified peer identity the link writes as the first line
//!   of every stream it hands to the daemon's remote entry.
//! - [`entry_path`]: where the daemon's remote entry listens, next to (never
//!   equal to) the session's local socket.
//! - [`dial`]: the `link.dial` request and reply on the link's local socket,
//!   and the service hello on an overlay stream.
//! - [`overlay_addr`]: the overlay address of an install.
//! - [`owner_session`]: the owner-only trusted session service of a paired
//!   server (who may open it, which socket it reaches).
//! - [`pairing`]: the paired peers the link accepts and dials (slice 1: a
//!   file written by `cmux link peer add`).
//! - [`registration`]: `link.json` in the daemon state dir, which names
//!   the running link's socket.
//! - [`connect_info`]: Cloud host ids resolved through
//!   `cloud.machine.connect_info`, cached without their tokens.
//! - [`token`]: the host side's link token check (deny by default).
//! - [`keyset`]: the Cloud host's link-token keyset: the reader of a keyset
//!   answer and its refresh schedule.
//! - [`caller`]: who may connect to the link's socket and to the daemon's
//!   remote entry (same user, and on macOS the cmux code signature).
//! - [`app_caller`]: whether a local peer, named by its audit token, is the
//!   signed cmux app that contains this binary (the daemon's `verified_app`).
