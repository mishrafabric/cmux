# Icon picker bench on a GUI host (cmux-lawrence-2 or a fleet Mac with a console; never the
# laptop: wk-bench opens a small non-activating panel). Run from a checkout at the commit to
# measure:
#   webviews/bench/icon-picker/run-gui.sh [out-dir]
# Writes <out-dir>/catalog.json (the system SF Symbol catalog as the host sends it) and
# <out-dir>/wk-bench.json (open, keystroke, scroll fps per grid and rendering mode, jumps).
# With bun and webviews/node_modules present it also writes <out-dir>/model-bench.json (the
# headless store bench on the real catalog).
