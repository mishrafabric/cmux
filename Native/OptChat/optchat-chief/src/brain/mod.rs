//! The brain: one thread that owns the host state and turns inputs (daemon
//! events, acpmux events, turn workers' reports) into effects. It keeps the
//! queue of new messages and runs the turn loop of section 7:
//!
//! ```text
//! on message: if a call is running: deliver it between tool calls
//!             else: queue.push(text); if idle: turn()
//! turn: settle (worker) -> take the queue -> render the view -> log the
//!       messages as `user` -> fresh call (worker) -> post the reply
//! ```
//!
//! Delivery between tool calls depends on the engine. The native engine
//! (`Engine::Native`, the host's own Messages API loop) asks the brain for
//! queued messages at every tool boundary, so MASTER's "messages the user
//! sends while you work reach you between tool calls" holds. The acpmux
//! engine cannot: claude-sr reports no steering. There a human message
//! stops the running turn (`session/cancel`; its steps are already in the
//! log) and the next fresh turn takes the message with the view of
//! everything the stopped turn did. A turn that hangs is stopped by
//! `Settings::turn_limit`.
