//! Which acpmux harness may answer for the Chief (Lawrence, 2026-10-05:
//! "we have our own version that uses claude code cli stdio, ensure only
//! that one is being used").
//!
//! A Claude harness is admitted only when acpmux reports it as kind
//! `claude-stdio`: acpmux's own Claude Code adapter (`claude_stdio`), which
//! drives `claude -p --input-format stream-json`. An external ACP adapter
//! (`claude-acp`, kind `acp`) is refused, whatever its profile is named. An
//! acpmux can carry one under the reserved names: `~/.acpx` entries are
//! imported as kind `acp`, and a failing `sr claude proxy` launcher is
//! replaced by a copy of the `claude` profile.
//!
//! The reserved names are routes, not profile names: `claude-sr` asks for a
//! `claude-stdio` profile whose command is `sr claude proxy` (the team
//! subrouter pool), `claude` for one whose command is `claude` (the direct
//! login). The profile is found by kind and command in `_acpmux/harnesses`,
//! so a user profile named `claude` that runs an ACP adapter is never
//! picked. Any other harness keeps its name; a Claude-family one must still
//! be kind `claude-stdio`. Codex and the other families are not Claude and
//! are admitted as acpmux reports them.
