//! OptChat memory (plans/cmux-next/optchat.md): one endless chat whose memory
//! is the chat itself. Every message is appended to a log; a background
//! compactor builds a purely binary tree of one-line summaries; each turn
//! reads a fixed-size view of the whole chat that changes only near its end.
//!
//! This crate is the pure part, shared by every placement: the Rust daemon
//! (on the user's MacBook or Mac mini) and the hosted Durable Object (as
//! WebAssembly). It does no I/O: hosts store messages and nodes, call the
//! model, and keep time. The behavior follows Victor Taelin's OptChat
//! specification (published for replication); section numbers in comments
//! refer to it.
