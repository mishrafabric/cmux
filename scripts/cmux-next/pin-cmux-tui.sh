# Fetch the hosted macOS arm64 cmux-tui that the cmux-next app bundles.
#
# Two modes. Dogfood, tagged, fleet and nightly builds use tree mode; only
# release and RC builds use the pin.
#
# tree (default): the daemon built from this checkout's own cmux-tui source.
#   The key is a git tree hash of the binary's source inputs
#   (scripts/cmux-next/cmux-tui-tree-inputs.txt: the cmux-tui tree, the
#   ghostty-next gitlink and the reducer FFI build script), computed by
#   scripts/ci/cmux_tui_tree_key.py (`pin-cmux-tui.sh key`). That is key v2.
#   Key v1 also hashed the classic `ghostty` gitlink, which no cmux-tui binary
#   builds from since 0c9d74bc3ea (CMUX-TUI-TREE-KEY-V2). Until v1 goes away,
#   fetch and resolve-commit take the v2 publication, else the v1 publication
#   of the same commit (`key --version v1`), and the workflow publishes both.
#   The `cmux-tui artifacts` workflow runs on every push to feat-cmux-next,
#   feat-cmux-next-acpmux and cmux-tui-pin-* that touches cmux-tui, ghostty or ghostty-next.
#   After the hosted build and the cmux_next_ daemon tests pass on that commit,
#   it publishes https://files.cmux.com/cmux-tui/tree/<key>/ with
#   cmux-tui-aarch64-apple-darwin, cmux-tui-aarch64-apple-darwin.sha256 and
#   source.json (the commit and run that built it). `fetch` downloads it to
#   cmux-tui/target/hosted/tree/<key>/cmux-tui and checks the published
#   sha256. When the key is not published yet it waits, printing progress, up
#   to CMUX_TUI_TREE_WAIT_SECONDS (default 2700), then fails. It never falls
#   back to another binary. In CI the wait also reads the cmux-tui artifacts
#   runs of CMUX_TUI_TREE_PUBLISHER_SHA (the pushed commit; needs GH_TOKEN with
#   actions: read) every CMUX_TUI_TREE_RUN_CHECK_SECONDS (default 300) and fails
#   fast when two checks in a row find no active run: the runs were cancelled,
#   superseded (finished without publishing) or never started. An active run, or
#   an API it cannot read, keeps the bounded wait. A fleet build that already compiled this source
#   (the cmux recipe's cmux_tui_client phase sets CMUX_TUI_CLIENT_LOCAL)
#   is used instead when its build commit has the same key: `fetch` then
#   downloads nothing, and the bundle phase records source=tree-local-build.
#   To publish the tree of an unmerged branch:
#     git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/cmux-tui-pin-<short-sha>
#     gh workflow run cmux-tui-artifacts.yml --ref cmux-tui-pin-<short-sha>
#   (dispatch only when the push started no run: a push starts one only when
#   commits new to the repository change cmux-tui, ghostty or the workflow).
#   Uncommitted changes under cmux-tui/ (or a ghostty checkout that differs
#   from the gitlink) are not in the published binary, so `fetch` refuses
#   them unless CMUX_NEXT_TUI_ALLOW_DIRTY=1. CMUX_NEXT_TUI_BIN=<path> bundles a
#   local build instead.
#
# pin (release and RC builds only; `--pin` or CMUX_NEXT_TUI_MODE=pin):
#   scripts/cmux-next/cmux-tui.pin names one commit, its public
#   commit-addressed binary, the publishing run (run=), the cmux-tui.yml run
#   that verified it (verified_run=) and the binary's sha256. Release jobs
#   install that commit's universal client. Dogfood builds do not need a pin
#   bump. Refresh the pin only for a release:
#     1. ./scripts/verify-cmux-tui-hosted.sh --filter cmux_next_ on the commit.
#     2. Publish that commit's binaries: git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/cmux-tui-pin-<short>
#        and, when the push starts no run, gh workflow run cmux-tui-artifacts.yml --ref cmux-tui-pin-<short>.
#     3. ./scripts/cmux-next/pin-cmux-tui.sh pin --commit <sha> --verified-run <run-id>
#     4. Commit scripts/cmux-next/cmux-tui.pin; delete the helper branch.
#     5. GPLv3 source availability: tag the pinned commit (and every commit a
#        vendor pins) with an annotated tag and push it:
#          git tag -a cmux-tui-src-<first 11 of sha> <full sha> -m "source for vendored cmux-tui crates"
#          git push origin refs/tags/cmux-tui-src-<first 11 of sha>
#        Never move or delete these tags.
#     6. Third-party notices: when cmux-tui.pin moves, regenerate them with
#        ./scripts/cmux-next/generate-third-party-notices.sh and commit
#        THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md (and cmux-tui/build-support/notices/REVIEW.md
#        when it changes) with the pin. The cmux-tui-src-<first 11 of sha> tag
#        from step 5 must exist first; the generator refuses without it.
#
# App host (cmux-app-host, apps-v1): both modes also fetch the app host the
#   same build published, cmux-tui-app-host-<target> in the commit-addressed
#   manifest of the commit that built the binary (source.json's commit in tree
#   mode; app_host_url= and app_host_sha256= in the pin). It goes next to the
#   binary as cmux-app-host, sha256-checked. A build that published none bundles
#   none (tree mode records `none` in cmux-app-host.sha256; a pin without the
#   app_host fields stays valid), and the daemon then does not serve apps-v1.
#   The first-party Cloud app server rides the same way: cmux-tui-cloud-server-<target>
#   goes beside it as cmux-cloud (cmux-cloud.sha256; cloud_server_url= and
#   cloud_server_sha256= in the pin); without it the supervisor answers
#   apps.server_missing for cmux/cloud.
#   The browser host rides the same way too: cmux-tui-browser-host-<target> goes
#   beside it as cmux-browser-host (cmux-browser-host.sha256; browser_host_url=
#   and browser_host_sha256= in the pin), where the daemon looks for it (the
#   sibling of its own executable); without it the daemon has no browser host.
#
# No mode needs GitHub credentials: downloads are public and sha256-checked.
#
# Usage: pin-cmux-tui.sh fetch [--tree|--pin] | path [--tree|--pin] | key [--version v1|v2] [--rev <rev>]
#        | app-host-path [--tree|--pin] (where fetch puts the app host)
#        | cloud-server-path [--tree|--pin] (where fetch puts cmux-cloud)
#        | browser-host-path [--tree|--pin] (where fetch puts cmux-browser-host)
#        | resolve-commit (the commit that published this tree; waits for it)
#        | resolve-newest-published (nightly: newest verified published tree in the last
#          CMUX_TUI_TREE_SEARCH_COMMITS commits, default 50, and CMUX_TUI_TREE_MAX_AGE_HOURS,
#          default 24; never waits; CMUX_TUI_TREE_SAME_PATHS, space-separated
#          paths, skips a commit whose copy of any of them differs from the tip's)
#        | wait (wait for the tree; superseded=true output for a superseded commit)
#        With CMUX_TUI_TREE_DISPATCH=1 (and GH_TOKEN or an authenticated gh), a tree that
#        no active run publishes gets one cmux-tui-artifacts run on cmux-tui-pin-<sha12>.
#        | probe (the cmux-next same-tree check: look once, never wait; writes tree_state=
#          ready|deferred|superseded|failed, tree_key= and tree_reason= to GITHUB_OUTPUT)
#        | local-build <binary> (exit 0 when that build has this checkout's key)
#        | show | pin --commit <sha> [--verified-run <id>]
