## herdr agent-detection plugin

cmux includes a userland agent-detection plugin derived from herdr. Its
manifests and adapted detector sources live under
`cmux-tui/bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/`.

- **Package license:** GPL-3.0-or-later AND Apache-2.0
- **Herdr-derived material:** Apache License 2.0
- **Source:** https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr
- **Detector source reference:** commit `7b675f42af35508eab66ac42fe1598628597a893`
- **Pi bundled-launcher correction:** commit `b1ff4582e9688f52ffb943cfa8bee4871ae122e4`
- **Manifest snapshot:** commit `2290257acb2085ce6842ba5c7e3ca50c3ba64f02`
- **Included manifest fixes:** Claude MCP elicitation `f807b697353cfa00aa912c7cde4830e863001cf5`, Claude background-shell state `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`, Codex weak-blocker scope `f457cff4f2648eee85d176f8a41861241d4e8428`, and Copilot background-agent activity `2290257acb2085ce6842ba5c7e3ca50c3ba64f02`
- **License text:** cmux-owned code is covered by
  `cmux-tui/bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/LICENSE`; the
  herdr-derived files use
  `cmux-tui/bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/manifests/LICENSE`
- **Latest agent-surface capability audit:** commit `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`. The herdr repository tip checked on 2026-09-02 is `94f6d9c0d9bb9cf9ffae99d8bbfb09e9bf2fc9e0`; commits after the audit pin change client rendering, terminal reads, graphics ownership, Windows input and worktree handling, or sidebar focus, with no further `src/detect` or manifest changes. The audit includes the exact Pi bundled CLI path correction from `b1ff4582e9688f52ffb943cfa8bee4871ae122e4` and the Claude background-shell state correction from `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`, both adapted and tested in the userland package. The first-acquisition OSC retention fix from `82e6a80eb3ae39fb3d3ebd4d1fed19389767e605` is adapted in the userland tracker. The foreground group-leader CWD fix from `3a3792622e59c7f2dc20f9c0236167161e4a5035` is already covered by cmux's generic `foreground_cwd` resource. The shell-render refactor in `207be3c771d281baae6e5fa0fb74be9a056e97a2` and independent multi-client tab views in `6c0bb273d5d5405a00985621b17e36f8b4d64609` are application/client architecture and are not copied. The delayed-agent-prompt fix in `8633a398e653eee47b375c963996c78a8a14aa48` changes PTY input sequencing, and `5616196942cbe752cc0659b9bd0fb616b2a6ed5c` hardens malformed Windows process environments in portable-pty. These changes are outside detector behavior and are not copied. SDK endpoint-generation compatibility remains a standalone-release requirement; review the Windows changes before publishing a Windows package.

Nineteen manifests are unchanged from the manifest snapshot. `claude.toml` is
byte-identical to upstream commit `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`.
`grok.toml` is based on the snapshot file and contains one documented cmux
precedence correction. `github-copilot.toml` is byte-identical to the snapshot
and uses upstream version `2026.08.29.1`. The manifest engine, process discovery, state detector, and update
logic are adapted for the cmux userland plugin contract. The source paths,
commits, license, and adaptations are recorded in
`cmux-tui/bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/ATTRIBUTIONS.md`.
The SHA256SUMS file is a checked-in byte-provenance record verified before the
bundled manifests are compiled. It detects accidental drift, but it is not a
cryptographic release signature for remote updates.

## executor (integration ingestion and tool policy)

cmux includes integration ingestion (OpenAPI, GraphQL and MCP) and tool policy
code adapted from executor in the package `libs/integrations-core/`
(`@cmux/integrations-core`, GPL-3.0-or-later AND MIT). The `cmux/integrations` app bundles that package
into `first-party-apps/integrations/dist/main.js`.

- **License:** MIT License
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2026 Rhys Sullivan
- **Source:** https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor (commit `98d606bd2b47b9dcc2c03a129a14b5134d9852c8`)
- **License text and adapted-file list:** `libs/integrations-core/LICENSE-executor` and

## cmux browser host runtime JavaScript

`bin/cmux-browser-host` embeds its runtime JavaScript (cmux-tui `crates/cmux-browser-host/js`, every file of `js/manifest.json`). Three embedded files are third-party code; the rest is cmux's own code (GPL-3.0-or-later, `Contents/Resources/LICENSE`). Rows: `cmux-tui/build-support/notices/browser-host/browser-host-js.json`.

- `vendor/acorn.js`: acorn 8.16.0 (https://github.com/acornjs/acorn), `dist/acorn.js` unmodified; MIT (text below)
- `vendor/playwright-injected.js`: Playwright (playwright-core 1.57.0, https://github.com/microsoft/playwright), `lib/generated/injectedScriptSource.js` (the evaluated source string, unmodified); Apache-2.0 (LICENSE and NOTICE below)
- `vendor/playwright-locator-utils.js`: Playwright (playwright-core 1.57.0), `lib/utils/isomorphic/locatorUtils.js` and the escape helpers of `lib/utils/isomorphic/stringUtils.js`; the functions are unchanged, the module wrapper was changed by cmux (the file header says so); Apache-2.0 (LICENSE and NOTICE below)

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## Rust and Zig Standard Libraries

Every Rust binary in this app statically links the Rust standard library
(`std`, `core`, `alloc`, `compiler_builtins` and the crates they vendor) of
the rustc that built it. The Rust project publishes the notices for that code
with each release as `COPYRIGHT-library.html`. This app ships that file,
unchanged, for each rustc that built one of its binaries:

- `Contents/Resources/toolchain-licenses/rust-1.95.0/COPYRIGHT-library.html`:
  `bin/cmux`, `bin/cmux-tui-ssh/*`, `bin/cmux-app-host` and `bin/cmux-cloud`
- `Contents/Resources/toolchain-licenses/rust-1.91.0/COPYRIGHT-library.html`:
  iroh-ffi (`Iroh.framework`; Release builds merge its code into the app binary)
- `Contents/Resources/toolchain-licenses/rust-1.98.1/COPYRIGHT-library.html`:
  `bin/cmux-diff-sidecar`

The app (GhosttyNextKit), `bin/cmux` and `bin/cmux-tui-ssh/*` (libghostty-vt)
and `bin/ghostty` link the Zig 0.16.0 standard library and compiler_rt:

- **License:** MIT License (Expat)
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) Zig contributors

## musl (in the Zig standard library)

GhosttyNextKit (Ghostty's terminal library in this app) contains code from the Zig standard library that Zig ported from musl: std.math.cbrt (musl src/math/cbrtf.c and src/math/cbrt.c), which Ghostty's terminal I/O uses to generate its 256-color palette. musl is licensed under the MIT license. The text below is the COPYRIGHT file of musl 1.2.5 (https://musl.libc.org/releases/musl-1.2.5.tar.gz), the musl release that Zig 0.16.0 bundles.

Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
under terms compatible with the above MIT license:

The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The
included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in
the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.

Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is
Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier or
Copyright © 2017-2018 Arm Limited
and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.

The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright © 2008
The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.

The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are
Copyright © 1999-2019, Arm Limited.

The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.

The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was
originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.

The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011
Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.

The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under
the standard MIT terms.

The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.

The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is
licensed under the standard MIT terms.

The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
under the standard MIT terms.

All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
interest of source tree size.

In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
license, and to use these files without any requirement of
attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:

Bobby Bingham
John Spencer
Nicholas J. Kain
Rich Felker
Richard Pennington
Stefan Kristiansson
Szabolcs Nagy

all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.

This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.
