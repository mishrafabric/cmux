#!/bin/sh
# Rebuilds the generated files that are still committed and stages them, after
# merging feat-cmux-next (or main) into a branch: the strings tables
# (webviews/src/**/generated/strings.json, from the xcstrings catalogs).
#
# The web bundles (agent pane, pages, Agent Activity, palette ranker, webviews
# app) are build output since cx-vn5 and gitignored; every build path runs
# scripts/cmux-next/build-web-bundles.sh. A merge with a branch from before that
# change gets modify/delete conflicts on them. This resolves those by removing
# them from the index (`git rm --cached`; the deletion wins), which is also how
# a main -> feat-cmux-next sync resolves main's changes to
# Resources/markdown-viewer/webviews-app.
#
# .gitattributes routes the still-committed files through the
# `cmux-generated-v1` merge driver, which keeps this branch's copy when both
# sides changed one. That copy is stale until this script runs. Nothing runs
# this automatically: a merge hook that builds the tree would execute whatever
# the merged branch contains.
