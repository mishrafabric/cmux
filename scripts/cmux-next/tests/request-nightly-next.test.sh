# request-nightly-next.sh: feat-cmux-next asks main to promote a commit to
# nightly-next only when that commit's cmux-tui tree is published AND its
# "cmux-next Release compile (Xcode 26)" passed. Whichever of the two finishes
# last asks (cmux-next.yml after the Release compile, cmux-tui-artifacts.yml
# after the publication), so nightly-next always points at a commit the
# nightly can build with its own workflow and its own daemon.
#
# Regression: nightly-next runs 37767816879 and 37769010617 (2026-10-08) were
# promoted to 0b7998925b6c and 273cd24a512b, whose tree 4573d47a0116 was still
# building. The resolver fell back to older published trees, but every one of
# them sat before 0b7998925b6c's nightly.yml edit, so the tip's workflow could
# not build any of them and the run failed. No network: stub curl and gh.
