"""Choose the live route for trusted side-lane jobs and record idle runners.

Side-lane workflows (owned_pool_rescue.SIDE_WORKFLOW_PATHS) have no picker.
On attempt 1 of a trusted run their macOS jobs took vars.CI_SIDE_LANE_RUNNER,
the std minis' glaeda-side-* label, whatever the fleet's load. When every side
runner was busy, the jobs sat queued until ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml's budget
(90 s) ran out, and the rescue cancelled the run and re-ran it; attempt 2 took
Blacksmith. Of 60 cmux-next.yml runs on 2026-10-02 (UTC), 49 needed attempt 2,
and in each attempt 1 sampled the Mac jobs never got a runner.

A workflow's placement job runs this before its macOS jobs, on attempt 1 of a
trusted run. It lists the runners through the org route App
(pr_runner_pool.GitHub.runners(), as admission_placement.py does) and places
JOBS, in priority order, with pr_runner_pool.idle_placement(), the rule the
main picker places the light side lanes with: one job per runner carrying
SIDE_LABEL that is online and idle now. When no online runner carries the side
label, jobs use its owned pool label so the std minis can accept them. When a
side label is online but busy, jobs remain on it and the rescue supplies the
measured overflow boundary after the mini queue drains.

Anything uncertain decides nothing and keeps the owned label watched by the
rescue: an attempt after 1, a SIDE_LABEL that is not a glaeda-side-* label (a
fork, owned pools off, the variable unset), or runners that cannot be read.

Outputs, each job key delimited by spaces with one at each end so a runs-on's
contains(' <key> ') matches whole keys only:
- `owned_jobs`: the jobs an idle owned runner takes;
- `fallback_jobs`: retained for the workflow output contract and always empty;
- `runner`: the live side label, or the owned pool label when no online side
  runner carries it;
- `watch`: "false" when every job took its fallback, so the run uploads no
  owned-pool-watch marker; "true" otherwise.
