# cmux next: browser host (agent browser use, WebKit and Chromium)

Design note, 2026-10-01. Owner: the cmux-next browser-use lead. Binding inputs: cmux-next-spec `spec/browser-use.md` (draft 2), `decisions.md` D12 and D20, `references/browser-use.md`, `references/browser-repl-inventory.md`; OWNERSHIP-PRINCIPLES.md; browser.md (CEF fork, shim, R2). Base implementation: PR https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/15570 (`cmux browser repl`, owner session feat-browser-repl-parity-8c, called "the REPL session" below). Its driver protocol ([browser-repl/driver-protocol.md](browser-repl/driver-protocol.md), moved from `docs/browser-repl`) is the contract this note builds on; its `tests/browser-parity` is the conformance suite. This note does not change either; changes to them go to the REPL session through the coordinator.

> **Resume note (parked 2026-10-03, browser-use lead):**
> 1. Branch `feat-cmux-next-browser-host-b` (head 1471aaaea0c, rebased on feat-cmux-next): REPL VM, policy gate, request interception, MCP port; review round 3 CLEAN; hosted full run 37074766904 FAILED: lint/test (linux) = one clippy unused_qualifications in server.rs (fixed in a later push), test (linux) also cmux-conversation conformance (another lane's crate), one job 'Formatting issues found' (check if ours). Next: rerun `./scripts/verify-cmux-tui-hosted.sh --full`, then push to feat-cmux-next with a COORDINATION line.
> 2. Branch `feat-cmux-next-wake-post` (head pushed, not landed): POST pages never hibernate (WebKit tracker + CEF shim export). Swift tests green via nx-remote; shim compile UNVERIFIED (nx-remote ssh dropped). Next: `scripts/cmux-next/ensure-cef.sh` + `build-cef-shim.sh` on the build host, gates, then land.
> 3. Landed today: quit-order fix a73630ec329, SIGPIPE no-op handler 3114269a0cd. Open after landing b: seal tabs (decision 8), owner policy path (fail-closed setup, real-Chromium worker/WebSocket tests), WebRTC, native fetch, conformance (measured on the Linux Testbox 2026-10-04: host-headless 3/37 before the agent-world fix, 11/37 after it; the earlier 11/33 note was not reproduced).
> 4. Waiting on the CEF fork lane: cmux.14 pin (adopt `cmux_tab_duplicate` behind `browser.duplicateRight`), watchdog/signal-handler change.
> 5. Decided (Lawrence, BR-R3, 264f11c): keep all WebSockets blocked while any domain policy is active. The cmux-conversation conformance red is a base red (fixed by the Home corpus fix), not ours.

## Decisions (Lawrence, 2026-10-01, via the coordinator)

1. **Daemon-supervised host, app as engine provider (decided).** It must just work: the host starts on demand with no setup, restarts after a crash, the app's provider reconnects by itself, sessions survive an app restart, and the UI shows a clear state when an engine is unavailable (section 1, "Lifecycle and user-visible state").
2. **#15570 port: the coordinator's mover agent** moves the runtime JS, docs, `tests/browser-parity` and the WebKit driver onto feat-cmux-next (paths agreed with the browser-use lead: JS in `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-browser-host/js/`, docs in `plans/cmux-next/browser-repl/`, suite at `tests/browser-parity/`).
3. **Agent-supplied secrets: allowed, masking only (decided).** Passwords are never secrets: agents use the Secure sign-in sheet and get a status (coordinator, Leo's cc-next-browser lane owns import and passwords).
4. See 2.
5. **No host|inapp switch (decided).** cmux-next uses only the Rust host for Chromium and WebKit.

6. **WebKit driver in Swift (decided, no Rust spike).** `CmuxNextBrowserAutomation` behind `DriverCallHandler`, built by the mover agent.
7. **Engines (decided).** Chrome and WebKit are both first class in the host, CLI, MCP and code mode: same API, same conformance goldens. Chrome is the default engine: `browser.repl.open {engine: "auto"}` resolves to in-app Chromium (CEF) on the Mac and headless Chromium on Linux. WebKit is reachable only through the CLI (`--engine webkit`), MCP (`engine: "webkit"`) and the Cmd-Shift-P palette; no menu, right-click or new-tab-page entry.

8. **Secrets read back by agent code (decided: sealed tabs now, engine-level read masking later).** Lawrence's question: an agent can save a value to a global or install a shim before the fill. Sealing therefore works like this:
   - The secret never enters the agent's JS VM: the VM holds a vault handle; the host types the value through trusted engine input.
   - Before a secret fill, the host SEALS and RESETS the tab: arbitrary `frame.evaluate` (page and agent worlds), raw CDP, `addInitScript` and user scripts, service-worker registration by the agent and agent-world injection are disabled for that tab; agent-installed init scripts are removed; the page is reloaded fresh, so no agent global or shim survives in the page or the agent world.
   - The fill happens only through the Secure sign-in sheet (user-confirmed) into that clean page.
   - The tab stays sealed for its lifetime, or until it navigates to a different site and is reloaded fresh; results returned to the agent are masked.
   - Remaining risk: the site's own scripts and browser extensions can still read the field. Engine-level read masking (option 2) is the follow-up that closes this.
   - Tests (written first): an agent that installs a capture shim, a global, an init script or a service worker before the fill gets nothing; a sealed tab refuses evaluate and raw CDP; a sealed tab unseals only after a cross-site navigation plus fresh reload.

9. **Passkeys (Lawrence, D1-D6).** D1 measure WebKit's native passkey flow first; D2 keep Chrome's own passkey dialog, restyle only behind a Debug setting; D3 disable Chrome profile passkeys; D4 agents refuse passkey prompts by default (a leased tab's WebAuthn request fails for the agent and goes to the user through the sign-in duplicate); D5 expose Chrome's passkey pages (chrome://settings/passkeys) through the palette; D6 land #12857 in the release lane.
10. **Duplicates and restores never replay a POST (BR-R1).** WebKit: `RestorePostGuard` cancels a main-frame POST that a restore starts (`backForward`, `formResubmitted`, `reload`) until the restore's first commit, then loads the original's URL by GET; `WebKitTab.duplicateSeed()/applyDuplicate(_:)` carry history, scroll and the top-origin sessionStorage (one-shot seed in world `cmux.duplicate`, removed at first commit); pages that show a POST result never hibernate. CEF: `cmux_tab_duplicate` (fork API 16) reloads a POST entry as GET; `cmux_tab_restore_navigation` (API 10) covers hibernation, so browser.md's `cmux_browser_restore_navigation` (would need API 17) is dropped (lane 19 C1). With API 16 Chromium keeps the app's signal handlers; the app catches (never ignores) SIGPIPE/TERM/INT/HUP, so every exec'd child starts with defaults (C2); the app keeps its own quit deadline for a hung CefShutdown (C3).

```

- One host per daemon, not per app window or per session (decided 2026-10-05, replaces "one host per machine"): the daemon puts its host's sockets in a `bh-<digest>` directory beside its own socket and gives terminals it creates the agent socket as `CMUX_BROWSER_HOST_SOCKET`. Why: the stable app's daemon and every tagged build's daemon run on one Mac at the same time; with one machine-wide socket the second daemon's host cannot bind, and an agent in a tagged build's terminal would drive the stable app's tabs. Refs, leases and policy are facts of that daemon's host; a mux on another machine addresses that machine's daemon.
- The daemon starts the host lazily on the first `browser.*` op or the first provider connect, restarts it with `Backoff` after a crash, and stops it when idle with no provider and no session (one-shot `DemandTimer`, no polling). The host binary is the one `cmux` binary (`cmux browser host`); until #16174 merges it is a separate binary target `cmux-browser-host` of the same crate, and the subcommand wiring is a request to session feat-cmux-next-99.
- Crash isolation: a runaway session (15570 measured 7 GB once) hits the per-VM QuickJS memory limit and interrupt deadline and fails alone; a host crash loses sessions and refs but no tab, page or layout state (owned by the app and the store).
- Cost: one local IPC hop per driver call. 15570 already batches frame reads (`frame.contentFrames`); the host keeps that and adds `batch` frames (several driver calls in one message) where the runtime issues independent calls.

### Lifecycle and user-visible state

- Start: the first `browser.*` op (CLI, MCP, mux) or the first provider connect makes the daemon start the host. No setup step, no flag.
- Crash: the daemon restarts the host with `Backoff`. Sessions are lost (their VM state is in memory); the next `browser.repl.eval` on a lost session answers `session_lost` with the session id, and `browser.repl.open` with the same id creates it again. Tabs, pages and layout are untouched.
- App restart: the provider connection drops; the host keeps sessions and marks their tabs `provider_gone`. Calls on those tabs wait up to their deadline for the provider to come back and re-announce the tab (same `targetId` from the store's tab record), else fail `closed`. When the app comes back it reconnects without user action.
- Engine unavailable (no CEF framework in the bundle, Chromium binary missing on Linux, WebKit provider absent): `browser.repl.open {engine}` and every call fail with `engine_unavailable {engine, reason}` (the reason text comes from `CEFUnavailableReason` on the Mac). The app shows the same reason on the lease badge and the browser pane notice; the CLI and MCP print it.
- Chromium on Linux: an optional Chrome for Testing bundle next to cmux-tui (`cmux browser install-chromium`, sha256-pinned), always baked into Freestyle snapshots; the host finds it before any system Chrome.

### Provider connection (app ↔ host)

Framing: length-prefixed JSON (u32 big-endian length, then UTF-8 JSON), one frame per message, both directions, max 64 MiB (screenshots). Frames:

| Frame | Direction | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hello {version, provider_id, install_id, engines: ["webkit","cef"], tabs: [TabAnnounce]}` | app → host | first frame; `TabAnnounce = {targetId, engine, workspace, profile, url, title, visible}` |
| `hello.ack {agent_bundle, agent_bundle_sha}` | host → app | the page agent bundle (manifest `agent` list, embedded in the host); the app installs it as document-start user scripts in the agent world of every driven tab, so there is one copy |
| `call {id, method, params}` / `result {id, result? , error?}` | host → app / app → host | driver protocol method on a WebKit tab (methods, params and errors exactly as driver-protocol.md) |
| `event {name, payload}` | app → host | driver protocol event (`tab.created`, `dialog.opened`, …) and provider events (`tab.announced`, `tab.gone`) |
| `cdp.attach {targetId}` / `cdp.detach {targetId}` | host → app | start or stop relaying a CEF tab's DevTools session |
| `cdp {targetId, message}` | both | one raw CDP message (string), passed through unparsed by the app |
| `lease {targetId, lease?}` | host → app | show or clear the "driven by" badge; the app never shows a lease it did not receive |
| `user.input {targetId}` | app → host | a person pressed a key or clicked in a leased tab; the host pauses that lease (spec risk "human and agent input") |
| `lease.user {op, targetId?, actor?}` | app → host | a person's lease action from the shared lease UI (origin `user`): `take_over`, `hand_back`, `stop` on `targetId`, `allow` for `actor` (a stopped principal) (plans/cmux-next/automation-lease.md). The host's lease table answers with `lease` frames |
| `tab.access {targetId, extension_host_access, user_override, extensions?}` | app → host | interim extension rule (2026-10-04): whether an enabled extension of the tab's profile holds host permissions on its page, and the person's per-tab override (native confirmation). The host refuses every call on a non-WebKit tab without a report, or with `extension_host_access` and no override: `forbidden`, `errorName: "extension_host_access"`, message "the tab's profile has an enabled extension with access to this page; open the tab with openBrowser profile \"agent\" (a profile without extensions), or ask the person to allow agents in this tab" (the app's control path uses the same text), data `{reason: "extension_host_access", extensions: [names]}`. Only the provider connection sends it |

Authentication: the daemon mints a per-launch provider secret when it starts the host and hands it to the app over the app's existing trusted daemon connection; the app proves it in `hello` and the host also checks peer credentials (same uid). A provider connection is never accepted from the agent listener. The host refuses a second provider with the same `install_id` (one app per install) and replaces it only after the first disconnects.

CEF relay: the shim gains `cmux_shim_devtools_send(browser_id, message_json)` (`CefBrowserHost::SendDevToolsMessage`, raw JSON with its own `id` and optional `sessionId`) and forwards every `CefDevToolsMessageObserver::OnDevToolsMessage` for attached browsers as a new shim event. Raw messages keep flat sessions, so out-of-process iframes work through `Target.setAutoAttach {flatten: true}`. Every tab under an agent lease turns password fill off before the first agent action (Leo's browser lane rule, 2026-10-01): the provider's lease path calls `TabContentCache.markAgentDriven(key)` for every engine, and for CEF tabs also `cmux_tab_set_password_fill` (CEF fork API 15) when the lease starts, restored when it ends. The setting is per WebContents and popups do not inherit it (CEF fork review): a tab opened by a leased tab (`window.open`, `target=_blank`, popups the runtime adopts) joins the opener's lease, and the app applies the setting synchronously when it adopts the tab, before its first navigation, because a value filled before the call stays until reload. Step c carries a test for the popup case (a leased tab opens a login popup; the popup never fills a saved password). The existing `cmux_shim_devtools_call` path stays for the app's own uses (previews, occlusion snapshots). Header edit changes the shim ABI identity (browser.md "CEF shim ABI identity"); the relay needs no fork change.

### Agent protocol (host listener)

Catalog ops (owner `browser-host`), the runtime command list in spec/browser-use.md "APIs and ops": `browser.session.open/list/reset/close`, `browser.eval {session, code, max_output}`, `browser.snapshot`, `browser.screenshot`, `browser.wait`, `browser.dialog.respond`, `browser.filechooser.respond`, `browser.download.list/path`, `browser.cookies.*`, `browser.storage_state.save/load {scope}`, `browser.policy.set` (user origin only), `browser.secrets.load/list/delete` (user origin only), `browser.record.start/stop`, `browser.trace.export`, `browser.lease.take/release`, `browser.cdp` (grant), `browser.act` (fixed tool mode, opt-in). Framing: the cmux-tui request envelope (`{id, method, params, origin, idempotency_key?}`, `request-settled`), so the generated CLI and MCP clients reuse their transport. Runtime commands are at-most-once by request id; an input call whose result is lost is reported `ambiguous` and never replayed.

### frame.observe (agent reads that never act; browser lead, 2026-10-04)

`frame.observe {targetId, frameId?, method, args?}` calls one page agent function in the frame's agent world: `globalThis[Symbol.for("cmux.browserRepl.agent")][method](...args)`. The host writes the script; the caller sends only the name and JSON arguments (at most 8, at most 64 KiB). Allowlist (src/observe.rs): `ping`, `snapshot`, `stats`, `refState`, `refForHandle`, `elementAt`, `splitFrames`, `queryAll`, `describe`, `strictError`, `elementState`, `checkStates`, `rect`, `contentBox`, `iframeHandles`, `retarget`, `read`, `activeHandle`. Another name, or a `queryAll`/`strictError`/`splitFrames` selector that tests the `value` attribute (`[value^=...]`, also inside `internal:attr=`; an oracle on a field value): `forbidden`, `errorName: "observe_not_allowed"` (the runtime must not fall back to `frame.evaluate`); numbers in args above 1e9 are `invalid`; a host or engine without the method answers `unsupported` (the runtime falls back). Until the browser REPL owner switches the runtime's `Frame._agent` reads to it (S0c), the runtime still reads through `frame.evaluate`. Every engine runs it as the matching agent-world `frame.evaluate` (headless and CEF in `CdpDriver`, WebKit through the app's existing call). Lease: an observe never takes or blocks a lease, so a second session can read a held or paused tab, and it is the fresh read after a hand back. Page-world calls (`page.evaluate`, `evaluateHandle`, `addInitScript`) and the acting agent functions stay `frame.evaluate` = act.

Redaction (because observe reads a tab another session holds): a sensitive field is an `<input>` with `type=password` or an autocomplete token `one-time-code`, `current-password`, `new-password` or `cc-*`. `read(id, "inputValue")` (after the follow-label retarget) and `read(id, "getAttribute", "value")` on it give `********` (empty stays empty). In `snapshot`, `read`, `describe` and `strictError` results every sensitive field value or value attribute of the frame becomes `********` (substring for 4+ characters, whole string otherwise; also its HTML-escaped and whitespace-collapsed forms and its first 12 characters). The scan for those values reads within the page-read budget (page-agent.js `readBudget`: 250,000 elements, 2,000,000 characters of values, 8 s; shadow roots included, iteratively). A scoped read (`snapshot` with a `root`, `read` and `describe` of an element, `strictError` of its elements; `read inputValue` adds the control its label names) scans its part first: its subtrees, shadow roots included, and until none is left every element they name by id in any attribute (`aria-labelledby`, `for`, `aria-owns`, `list`, ...), their `labels` and the elements slotted into them (an accessible name or text can come from those); then the rest of the frame with what the budget has left. When the budget stops the scan of the scoped part, or of the whole frame for an unscoped read, the read is refused with the read-cut marker `{__cmuxReplyCut: {truncated, maxNodes, maxSize, scope: "part" | "frame"}}` (the runtime fails the call with core.readCutNote; for `"frame"` it adds: scope the read to a part of the page, `snapshot(ref)` or `snapshot(locator)`). A partial scrub of the part a read shows is never returned (lane e5 and ff, 2026-10-07). So an unscoped observe text read of a frame with more than 250,000 elements fails, and a scoped read of such a frame works. Known residual: on such a frame a scoped read is scrubbed only of its part's values (and of the rest's values the budget reached); a page that copies a sensitive value from outside the part into text inside it shows that text. The parity reference host (lib/reference-host.mjs, cmux-dev) does not scope: it refuses every text read of such a frame. A vault secret that any session typed into a tab is masked as `<secret:NAME>` (the vault masker) in every session's results, errors and events from that tab until it closes (`TabSecrets`); TOTP codes are not recorded yet (the classic REPL's generated-code masking and its wider encodings come with the masker port in S0b).

Sessions on the person's tabs: `cef` and `webkit` sessions need an explicit session name (the implicit `default` is refused). The lease badge label is the agent's label without control or invisible format characters, at most 48 characters, else the session name. `browser.repl.close` (and a reset) releases the session's leases at once through `Driver::end_session`; a closed engine's late drop does not touch a new session of the same name, and a closed engine refuses calls (`closed`). A `tab.gone` drops the tab's lease (host-local `TargetGone`). `lease.user {op: "allow", actor}` lifts a stop for that principal (lease v2).

### Surfaces: CLI, MCP and mux code mode (binding, Lawrence 2026-10-01)

Browser use is available through three surfaces, all generated from the one operation catalog (owner `browser-host`), all with the same persistent REPL session model:

| Surface | REPL | Discrete ops |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI | `cmux browser repl` interactive, and `cmux browser repl --session NAME --eval CODE\|-` one-shot (15570 grammar); `cmux browser repl list`, `reset`, `close`, `guide` | `cmux browser snapshot`, `screenshot`, `tabs`, ... from the catalog |
| MCP | `browser_repl_open {session?, profile?, label?} -> {session}`, `browser_repl_eval {session, code, timeout?, max_output?}`, `browser_repl_close {session}` | `browser_snapshot`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_tabs`, ... from the catalog (default group per operation-catalog.md) |
| mux code mode | the mux sends code to `browser.repl.eval` on a session it opened; the code runs in the host's QuickJS VM with the 15570 API (`page`, locators, `keyboard`, `mouse`, `tabs`, `snapshot`, ...) so one call scripts a multi-step task | same catalog ops as tools |

Catalog ops behind them: `browser.repl.open {session?, profile?, label?}` (creates or attaches by id; idempotent by `session`), `browser.repl.eval {session, code, timeout_ms?, max_output?}`, `browser.repl.close {session}`, `browser.repl.list`, `browser.repl.reset {session}`. A session keeps its VM state (top-level `const`/`let`, variables, open tabs, refs) between calls until `close`, `reset`, idle expiry, or a host restart. Every surface runs the same sandbox and the same policy, secret and masking rules (section 4), and every call is stamped with `origin` (`cli`, `mcp`, `remote` for a relayed mux) plus `actor` and `on_behalf_of` from the connection (section 3). There is no surface-specific runtime: the CLI, the MCP server (`cmux mcp`) and the mux tool layer are thin generated clients of these ops.

## 2. What runs where

| Piece | Where | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| page agent (`page-agent.js`) and Playwright injected script | in every frame, isolated world, installed by each driver | they read the live DOM and accessibility state; Rust cannot run there |
| runtime JS (`runtime-core.js`, `api.js`, `agent-tools.js` minus policy and secrets, `sites/*`, `repl-host.js`) | QuickJS-ng VM in the host | agent code is JS; the Playwright-model runtime is engine-neutral and proven by the suite |
| sessions, ref and frame bookkeeping, timers, fs sandbox, fetch with tab cookies | host (Rust) | one core for every engine; today Swift in `CmuxBrowser/Repl` |
| snapshot stitching, render, diff, print budget | host (Rust port), JS reference behind `CMUX_BROWSER_SNAPSHOT_CORE=js\|rust` (DEV) | page agent already emits raw per-frame nodes; QuickJS is slower than JSC on 50k-node trees |
| domain policy, subresource policy, secret vault, masking, raw CDP grant | host (Rust), below the VM | security blocker (section 4) |
| output cap and spill, action log, leases, recordings, evals | host (Rust) | bounded state the host owns |
| MCP tool descriptors | host exports catalog entries; `cmux mcp` (feat-cmux-next-mcp) serves them | one MCP server per machine, generated from the catalog (D7) |
| CDP driver | host (Rust), transports: relay (CEF in app), pipe (headless) | the same mapping for in-app and headless Chromium |
| WebKit driver (native NSEvent input, content worlds, `_frames:`, delegates, capture, off-screen key window) | Swift in the app | `WKWebView` exists only in the app process and needs AppKit and SPI |
| CEF DevTools relay, lease badge, user-input pause signal | Swift in the app (`CmuxNextBrowserHost`) | the app owns the browser runtime |

`__cmuxNative` keeps version 1 (driver-protocol.md "Native host contract") with two changes made in Rust: `driverCall` goes through the policy gate, and secret-bearing calls take handles (section 4). The VM stays swappable (V8 through `deno_core` if QuickJS-ng misses the perf gate).

### 2a. WebKit driver: Swift or Rust (evaluation)

Lawrence asked whether the WebKit driver can be Rust too: a Rust library linked into the app (objc2, objc2-web-kit), on the main thread, with Swift only hosting the view.

Feasible parts: objc2-web-kit binds `WKWebView`, `WKContentWorld`, `WKUserScript`, `callAsyncJavaScript:arguments:inFrame:inContentWorld:`, `takeSnapshotWithConfiguration:`, `createPDFWithConfiguration:`, and delegate protocols (`define_class!` implements `WKNavigationDelegate`/`WKUIDelegate`). SPI (`_simulateMouseMove:`, `_frames:`, `_setResourceLoadDelegate:`, `_doAfterProcessingAllPendingMouseEvents:`, `_WKContentWorldConfiguration`) is plain `msg_send!` behind `respondsToSelector:` checks, the same as Swift's dynamic calls. Native input (`NSEvent` construction, `sendEvent:` to the web view's window) works through objc2-app-kit. Threading: driver calls arrive off main; `MainThreadMarker` plus a main-queue hop (dispatch2) serializes them, as Swift's `@MainActor` does.

Costs that decide it:
- Delegate ownership: `WebKitTab` (Swift, `CmuxNextBrowser`) already owns the navigation, UI and download delegates for normal browsing. Dialogs, file choosers, popups and downloads must reach the driver, so a Rust driver needs either Swift to forward every delegate callback over FFI or Rust proxy delegates that forward to Swift. Both put a second owner on the same delegate surface.
- AppKit state the driver changes: the off-screen key render window, first responder, occlusion, the native drag session, and the virtual pasteboard swap are AppKit lifecycle code that the Swift app owns (focus.md, OWNERSHIP-PRINCIPLES "client owns the view"). Driving them from Rust crosses that boundary on every call.
- Build: a second Rust static library in the Xcode build (precedent: the CEF shim and diff sidecar), Swift 6.2 Release compile interplay, and an FFI ABI identity like the shim's.
- What moves: only engine-bound glue. Everything engine-neutral is already Rust in the host, so "Rust for both Chrome and WebKit" holds at the host level either way.

Recommendation: Swift WebKit driver now (`CmuxNextBrowserAutomation`, ported from the 1,620-line driver that passes the suite), exposed only through the driver protocol (`DriverCallHandler`). If Lawrence still wants Rust there, a bounded spike first: a Rust objc2 crate in the app that does `frame.evaluate` in a content world, `_simulateMouseMove:` hover and a trusted click on one tab, timed against the Swift path; decide on its numbers and on the delegate forwarding cost.

### CDP mapping (summary; the driver is done when the goldens pass)

| Driver method | CDP |
| --- | --- |
| `frames.list`, `tab.navigated` | `Page.getFrameTree`, `Page.frameAttached/Navigated/Detached`, OOPIF sessions from `Target.setAutoAttach {flatten}` |
| agent world | `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument {worldName: "cmux-agent", runImmediately}` per session, `Page.createIsolatedWorld` for frames that loaded before, context ids from `Runtime.executionContextCreated` (`auxData.frameId`, name) |
| `frame.evaluate` | `Runtime.callFunctionOn {executionContextId, functionDeclaration, arguments, awaitPromise, returnByValue}`; handles resolved in the agent world, moved to the page world with the same DOM-event trick as WebKit |
| `input.mouse/key/insertText` | `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`, `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` (Playwright key table), `Input.insertText`; top-level coordinates reach OOPIFs |
| `input.drag` | `Input.setInterceptDrags` + `Input.dispatchDragEvent` |
| hidden-tab focus | `Emulation.setFocusEmulationEnabled {enabled: true}` while driven |
| `tab.navigate/history/reload`, `loadState` | `Page.navigate`, `Page.navigateToHistoryEntry`, `Page.reload`, `Page.lifecycleEvent` (networkidle from lifecycle) |
| dialogs, file choosers | `Page.javascriptDialogOpening` + `Page.handleJavaScriptDialog`; `Page.setInterceptFileChooserDialog` + `DOM.setFileInputFiles` (host writes files to a per-session temp dir) |
| capture | `Page.captureScreenshot`, `Page.printToPDF` (headless; CEF uses the app's `PrintToPDF`) |
| network, console | `Network.*`, `Runtime.consoleAPICalled`, `Runtime.exceptionThrown` |
| cookies | `Network.getCookies/setCookies/clearBrowserCookies` (page session; CEF per request context) |
| subresource policy | `Fetch.enable` patterns + `Fetch.failRequest`/`continueRequest` decided in Rust |
| `clipboard.*` (virtual) | not in phase 2: capability absent, the runtime throws the reference error text; listed as a gap |

## 3. Ownership and identity

| Entity | Owner | Writers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| browser tab record (placement, URL revision, title, profile, engine) | workspace store | store ops only; the host never writes it, a navigation the agent causes reaches it through the app's `browser.navigated` op |
| page runtime (live URL, loading, history stack, crash) | the Mac app that renders the page | the app; the host reads it through the driver |
| sessions, refs, VM, action log, recordings, policy, secret vault | browser host | host only; non-durable except logs |
| automation lease `{targetId, session, actor, on_behalf_of, origin, label, since}` | browser host | host; the app renders the badge and sends Stop as `browser.lease.release` with origin `user` |
| headless Chromium tabs on a VM | that VM's host | host |

- Every agent request carries `origin` (channel) and the host derives `actor`, `on_behalf_of` and agent class from the connection (launch credential locally; relayed principal remotely). Every driver call in the action log carries them. No request without an actor reaches a driver once the launch credential ships; until then requests are attributed as plain CLI (spec gap, identity-and-permissions.md section 6).
- Agent tabs open in the workspace's agent profile by default (D12). A session may opt in to a signed-in profile only with `profile: "signed-in"` on `browser.session.open`, which needs origin `user` or a mux grant, and shows on the lease badge.
- Remote control (D20): the host listener is local only. The daemon relay forwards `browser.*` runtime commands only for `mux` principals of the host's owner, and the host checks the relayed principal class again (defense in depth). Ordinary agents on other machines get `forbidden`. Enabling the relay family needs the written relay analysis and policy tests from the cmux-next CLAUDE.md.
- Focus: driving never changes view state. `tabs.open` opens background tabs; `tab.bringToFront` is refused unless origin is `user` or the call passes `focus: true` (OWNERSHIP-PRINCIPLES "Clients are projections"). The host never renames tab titles (15570's `session.name` label becomes the lease label shown in the badge).

## 4. Security (blocker before MCP or remote use)

Finding (research/browser-use.md, by reading): in 15570 the domain policy and secret masking are JS in the same context as agent code, and `__cmuxNative.driverCall` is reachable, so agent code skips both. Rules in the host:

1. The VM's `__cmuxNative.driverCall` is a Rust function that checks every call before any driver sees it: navigation targets (`tab.navigate`, `tabs.open`, `tab.history` results, popups through `tab.created`), `fetch` URLs, `file://`, `chrome://`, `about:` other than `about:blank`, TLS-error interstitials, `browser.cdp` (grant), and `frame.evaluate {world: "page"}` (allowed; page JS cannot widen the policy because it runs in the page, not the host).
2. Subresource policy is built in Rust: CDP `Fetch` interception decisions, and WebKit `contentRules` computed by Rust and sent by the host, never taken from VM code.
3. Policy writes: `browser.policy.set` needs origin `user` (or the session's creator mux within its grant) and can `lock`. VM code may only narrow (`session.allowedDomains` intersects the locked policy).
4. Passwords never reach the host or the VM: `auth.request` is a driver method that the app answers with its own sheet and its bundled fill script (#15570 site-tools.md "Secure sign-in"); the host forwards the request and returns only the status (`submitted`, `cancelled`, `unavailable`, `expired`, `origin_changed`, `page_changed`, `locator_invalid`, `submission_failed`). On headless Linux there is no sheet, so `auth.request` answers `unavailable`. Saved passwords and browser data import belong to Leo's cc-next-browser lane; the host has no API that reads them.
5. Other secret values live only in the Rust vault until typed. The VM sees `{__secret: name}` handles. Host-only work (focus checks, select-all, capture masking) runs in a third world, `cmux-host`, that VM code can never target (`frame.evaluate {world: "host"}` from the VM is refused); typing goes through native input after the host checks the focused frame (engine frame URL, never page JS) against the secret's domains. Once typed, only a sealed, freshly reloaded tab holds the value (decision 8). `input.insertText {text: handle}` and `fill` are resolved by the host after it checks the focused frame's origin (driver `frames.list` plus the agent world's focus report) against the secret's domains; TOTP codes are computed in Rust.
6. Masking runs in Rust on every byte leaving the host: print output, results, errors, spill files, action log, recordings, event payloads, MCP responses. Screenshot masking stays a driver step (the page agent covers secret-bearing fields), ordered by the host around capture calls.
7. Page text is untrusted: snapshot and markdown output mark page-sourced text; the host never follows instructions from page content (it has no model loop).
8. Same-uid processes outside cmux are outside this boundary (the control socket default is `automation`, D16); the boundary is the agent session and the MCP client.

Tests (failing first): a VM call to `__cmuxNative.driverCall("tab.navigate", {url: "https://blocked.example"})` under a locked policy fails `forbidden`; `JSON.stringify(globalThis)` and a walk of every reachable object never contains a user secret value; a secret typed into a non-matching frame fails; masking covers a secret split across two print calls and inside an error stack.

## 5. Conformance and performance gates

Backends added to `tests/browser-parity` (through the REPL session): `host-headless` (Rust host + headless Chromium over the pipe, runs in hosted Linux CI and on the Mac), `host-cef` and `host-webkit` (tagged no-activate app with the host). All use `cmux browser repl --eval -` per cell (until the Rust CLI verb exists: `cmux-browser-host eval --session NAME [--engine E] -`) with the engine from `browser.repl.open {engine}` or `CMUX_BROWSER_HOST_ENGINE`, so the suite gains backends, not a fork. Same goldens on every engine; a deliberate engine difference goes into `capabilities.json` with a reason, never a per-engine golden.

Gate for shipping the host in NIGHTLY (the in-app runtime is not ported): `gate.sh` green on `host-webkit` and `host-cef` twice in a row and on `host-headless` in CI; 0 cmux-worse in the differential cases; perf within 15% of 15570's in-app numbers (p50/p95 ms, real app: 50k elements 419/522, 200k elements 2224, 300 iframes 179/686, 10k-row table 392, live GitHub PR files 225) on WebKit, and reported separately for CEF; idle host near 0% CPU and 0 wakeups/s (`bench-idle.sh`).

## 6. Steps (each lands on feat-cmux-next with failing tests first)

| Step | Content | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a | crate `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-browser-host`: driver protocol types, `Driver` trait, CDP transport trait, pipe transport, `CdpDriver` (tabs, navigate, frames, agent world, evaluate, input, screenshot), provider frame codec, host listener skeleton | hosted `--filter browser_host`; a Chromium integration test in the cmux-tui workflow (Playwright Chromium, as the existing CDP smoke) |
| b | QuickJS-ng sessions with `__cmuxNative` v1, policy gate, secret vault, masking, Rust snapshot core with the JS reference switch | unit tests above; suite `host-headless` on a hosted runner |
| c | app side: `CmuxNextBrowserHost` provider bridge (connection, `hello`, WebKit call forwarding to the ported driver, CEF relay via the shim, lease badge, user-input pause); shim `cmux_shim_devtools_send` + message forwarder | `swift build --build-tests`, module tests with a fake host; tagged no-activate live run |
| d | conformance runner: `host-*` backends, `gate.sh` against both engines, perf bench vs 15570 | numbers per engine in this note |
| e | catalog entries for `browser.*` (owner `browser-host`), CLI verbs generated (request to session feat-cmux-next-99), MCP default group through `cmux mcp` | generated surfaces checked by the catalog tests |

Order change (binding surfaces above): the REPL session ops (`browser.repl.open/eval/close/list/reset`) and their three surfaces move forward. Step b lands them on the host listener together with the VM, and the CLI and MCP clients for them land right after b (CLI through session feat-cmux-next-99, MCP through the `cmux mcp` owner), before c. The discrete ops follow in e.

### 6c. Step c slices (browser lead, 2026-10-04)

State at 109d9c613f8: the host has the frame codec, `accept` and `ProviderDriver` (provider.rs, provider_link.rs), but `server.rs` binds only the agent listener, `engines.rs` answers `cef` and `webkit` with `engine_unavailable`, the daemon does not start the host, and the app has no bridge. The shim relay pieces exist (`cmux_shim_devtools_send`, `CEFShimEvent.devToolsMessage`, raw ids from 2^30).

Threat that sets the secret path: a same-uid process (an agent in a terminal) must not be able to pose as the app, because the app's `tab.access` carries the person's per-tab override. Peer uid alone does not stop it, and a secret in a file, an argv or an environment variable is readable by the same uid. So the daemon mints the secret, passes it to the host on an inherited pipe (never argv or env), and gives it to the app only over the app's own daemon connection (app origin). The reverse threat is worse (a same-uid process that binds the provider socket path first would get the secret and then raw CDP on the person's tabs), so the host proves itself before the app sends the secret: `browser.host.provider` returns `{socket, secret, host_pid}` (the daemon started the host, so it knows the pid), and the app sends `hello` only after the socket's peer pid (`LOCAL_PEERPID`) equals `host_pid`. The daemon answers `browser.host.provider` only to a caller it proves to be the app (audit token, cmux team code signature, bundle id), never on client-declared identity.

| Slice | Content | Where | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| c1 | Host: provider listener (`browser-host-provider.sock` in the same 0700 dir, peer uid check, `accept`, one provider per `install_id`); secret read from an inherited fd (`--provider-secret-fd N`); engine routing: `webkit` tabs through `ProviderDriver` calls, `cef` tabs through `CdpDriver` on a relay transport (`cdp.attach`/`cdp`/`cdp.detach` frames on the provider connection) with the `tab.access` gate at that transport; `tab.gone` and provider disconnect fail pending calls `closed` | cmux-browser-host (crate slot) | hosted focused + a fake-provider integration test |
| c2 | Daemon: start and supervise the host (`Backoff`), mint the secret, pass the fd, app-origin op `browser.host.provider` -> `{socket, secret}`; refused for every other origin. Shipped as the raw command `browser-host-provider` (`browser-host-provider-v1`, spec/commands.md) -> `{socket, secret, host_pid}`: a v1 command reaches no app router, chief tool or resource catalog, so the only callers are socket clients, and the gate takes only the verified app (role `main` plus a proof) on the daemon's Unix socket. The host runs `serve --supervised` (prints `ready` once both sockets listen, exits at the end of stdin, so it stops with the daemon). The v1 command instead of the v2 operation is accepted (coordinator, 2026-10-05). The daemon binds its host's sockets when the binary exists, and only then names the socket to its terminals; a client never starts its own host on the daemon's socket (it waits up to 10 s), so no secretless host can take the socket before the app connects. Lands only AFTER the browser REPL owner's S0c (runtime agent reads through `frame.observe`): until c2, no build has a provider link, so no lease-gated read can go through `frame.evaluate` (coordinator, 2026-10-04) | cmux-tui (window) | hosted focused; origin refusal test |
| c3 | App: `CmuxNextBrowserHost` bridge: fetch `browser.host.provider` on daemon connect, dial, `hello` with every tab (`TabAnnounce`), `tab.announced`/`tab.navigated`/`tab.gone` events, WebKit `call` -> `WebKitDriver`, CEF `cdp.attach` -> raw relay via the shim, `tab.access` (`extension_host_access = !AgentExtensionAccess.fromDisk.blockers(store.extensions, url: tab.state.url).isEmpty`, `user_override = TabContentCache.agentMayUseExtensionTab(key)`, resent on URL change and extension store change), lease badge, `user.input`, `markAgentDriven` + password fill off on lease; reconnect after a host restart | CmuxNext (Swift) | module tests with a fake host; live check on cmux-lawrence-2: an agent opens, navigates, snapshots, clicks and types in a visible CEF tab through `browser.repl.eval` |

Order: c1 and c3 in parallel (c3 against a fake host), then c2, then the live check. relay-ext (the `tab.access` rule) lands before c1.

### 6d. Release artifact contract (Linux, for the cmux-next VM image)

The CI lead owns the workflow, signing and the manifest entry; this is the binary contract.

- Targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` (glibc; the VM image's glibc is the floor). One binary per target: `cmux-browser-host`.
- Build (from `cmux-tui/`, the pinned toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml`): `CMUX_BUILD_SHA=<40-char commit> cargo build --release --locked -p cmux-browser-host --bin cmux-browser-host --target <triple>`. It needs a C compiler for the target (QuickJS-ng through `rquickjs`); `build.rs` embeds `js/` (no files beside the binary). No runtime dependency other than glibc and libm; Chromium is found at run time (`CMUX_BROWSER_HOST_CHROMIUM`, then `~/.cache/cmux/chromium`, then system paths).
- Version: `cmux-browser-host version` prints one line `cmux-browser-host <crate version> (<CMUX_BUILD_SHA>)`, exit 0.
- Smoke (no Chromium needed): `cmux-browser-host version` exits 0 and names the commit; `cmux-browser-host guide` exits 0 with non-empty output; `cmux-browser-host serve --socket "$T/h.sock" &` then `cmux-browser-host list --socket "$T/h.sock"` exits 0 and prints `[]` (a pretty-printed JSON array; with sessions, one object `{"session", "engine", "createdBy", "origin"}` each; from `Host::list` in src/host.rs); then stop the server PID.
- Run-time switches for Cloud: `CMUX_BROWSER_HOST_HEADLESS=0` (headful Chromium), `CMUX_BROWSER_HOST_BACKGROUND_FULL_RATE=0` (let Chromium throttle background tabs). `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` are always refused.

### 6e. Step c known follow-ups (after c1, 44ce50ad735)

- Provider events go to every session of the provider; filter them per session engine (and per refusal state).
- Sessions stay bound to the provider connection they opened on; after the app reconnects they must attach to the new one (with c2's lifecycle).
- No `cdp.detach` when no session uses a CEF tab any more; tie it to the lease (release, session end).
- Lease follow-ups (review of the lease integration, browser lead v4): an agent release op and an idle TTL that ends a session's leases; a host-side allowlist of driver methods in `ProviderEngine::call` (unknown methods with a `targetId` are passed to the app today); `tab.pdf` as observe and `tab.keep` without a lease when those methods exist; the reader thread writes `lease` frames (the app must read on its own thread); decide user-origin REPL sessions.

- Known gap (a9 raw_value, 2026-10-05; owner v4, CEF provider): script values keep the page's object key order only on headless CDP (`Reply::Json` through `Driver::call_reply_announced`). CEF tabs through `ProviderEngine` and WebKit tabs still return a parsed `Value`, so their objects arrive with sorted keys (scenario 32 `search-duckduckgo`, `search-bing`). Fix: forward `call_reply_announced` in `ProviderEngine` to the tab's `CdpDriver`, and give the WebKit provider path a raw JSON reply.

### 6f. Step c2 follow-ups (accepted 2026-10-05)

- DONE (2026-10-05): idle stop with start on demand, by socket activation. The daemon binds both host sockets (with the lock files) and keeps them; while no host runs, one daemon thread blocks in poll(2) on the agent socket and a cancel pipe (the daemon's end writes it). The first agent connect starts a host with the sockets as fds 4 and 5 (`--agent-listen-fd`, `--provider-listen-fd`), and it accepts the queued connection. The host's `IdleExit` (injected clock, condition variable, no timer thread polling) exits with code 0 after `--idle-exit-ms` (5 min) with no session, no agent connection and no provider; the daemon then waits for the next connect. A crash (any other exit) restarts with Backoff and never through activation, so a crash loop stays slow. Decided trade-off: a connected app provider keeps the host (otherwise the app's reconnect would start it again at once, or the app would need a daemon "host started" event); the process goes away when no app is connected and when nothing used the browser.
- The host binary in the app bundle beside the daemon (`cmux-browser-host`), signed like the daemon: separate push.

- Host-followed fetch redirects and their addresses (SHELL-REDIRECT-LNA option 1, HOP-ADDRESS (2), 2026-10-05): the host fetches each hop with `redirect: "manual"` in a shell at the hop's origin; before the next hop starts it passes the domain policy and the private ranges (with the caller's locality). The redirect response's address comes from Chromium's next `Network.requestWillBeSent.redirectResponse.remoteIPAddress`, which Chromium sends also for a manual redirect (Testbox spike, Chromium 143); the hop's DNS rebinding check uses it, and a hop no longer waits 1 s for a response event. Remaining gap: rebinding is checked after the hop's response arrived (the bytes of that response were already fetched); the real fix is the pre-connect resolver hook (cmux.20 candidate 7), which refuses a refused address before the connection. Residual: an in-tab FIRST hop from a public page to a local address can still hit Chromium's local network rules (only later hops run in a shell at their own origin).

## 7. Prototype switches (DEV and NIGHTLY)

- `CMUX_BROWSER_SNAPSHOT_CORE=js|rust`: snapshot.js in the VM versus the Rust port; both must print byte-identical goldens.
- `CMUX_BROWSER_HOST_VM=quickjs|v8` (only if QuickJS misses the perf gate).

## 8. Not decided here, or UNVERIFIED

- QuickJS-ng speed on the runtime is unmeasured. CEF hidden-tab focus and hover under `Emulation.setFocusEmulationEnabled` is unverified. The Chromium sandbox on Freestyle VMs is unverified (never default to `--no-sandbox`).
- Virtual clipboard on CDP has no design yet (gap in section 2).
- Downloads on CEF come from the app's download handler, not CDP; the provider forwards them as driver events. Not yet specified frame by frame.
- Agent tabs outside the layout on the Mac stay out of phase 1 (spec open question).
