# Windows daemon mode for the GPUI app (bead cx-stg)

Status: design reviewed (GO with changes, 2026-10-07); experiments done; no code yet. Owner: GPUI lane. Base: feat-cmux-next
e98b689d646 (2026-10-07). Order (coordinator): this note, then the SDK
transport, then the daemon's Windows process data, then the Windows tree
artifact (with hq-ed). CORE/bindings pushes go through the CORE queue;
Cargo.lock changes need the LOCK.

## Goal

The GPUI app on Windows is a client of the cmux-tui daemon, as on macOS and
Linux: terminals live in the daemon, survive app restarts and daemon
restarts, other clients see them, and the hover card's CPU, memory and
folder come from the daemon. Today GPUI builds `daemon_off.rs` on Windows
(local shells only) because cmux-sdk is Unix-only.

## What exists

- Daemon transport: `cmux-tui-core/src/platform/transport.rs` has a
  `Stream` trait (Read + Write + try_clone_box + timeouts + shutdown) and a
  Windows implementation on `uds_windows` 1.2 (AF_UNIX, Windows 10 1803+).
  `connect_same_user` is a plain connect there (no peer credentials).
- Socket base on Windows: `std::env::temp_dir()` (per-user `%TEMP%`),
  user component `%USERNAME%` (`platform.rs runtime_base_dir`,
  `user_id_component`).
- Owner start on Windows: `local_owner.rs` probes the socket (no readiness
  pipe, no `waitid`, no install-key pipe: `install_key_from_fd` is a no-op
  there).
- PTYs: portable-pty's ConPTY backend (`cmux-pty`).
- CI: `cmux-tui.yml` `test-windows` runs `cargo test -p cmux-tui-core --lib`
  for `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` on a hosted Windows runner.
- Not on Windows: process trees, usage, foreground process, its name and cwd
  (`process_resources.rs` Sampler and `platform.rs foreground_*` return
  nothing; `reads_process_trees()` is false).
- Artifacts: `cmux-tui-build-package.yml` can build `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`;
  the tree publication forbids the Windows binaries today
  (`cmux-tui-artifacts.yml --forbid-artifact cmux-tui-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe`).

## 1. One local-socket transport: `cmux::local_socket` in cmux-sdk

Decision (coordinator, 2026-10-07, revised): the transport is a module of
cmux-sdk, `cmux::local_socket`, behind the `local-socket` feature (built
always on Windows, where the SDK connects through it). The daemon
(cmux-tui-core) depends on cmux-sdk with `default-features = false` and only
that feature, so one copy of the same-user checks serves daemon and clients,
without a new published crate (which would need a workflow change on main
and a crates.io web step). An earlier version of this branch had a separate
crate `cmux-local-socket`; it was folded in.

Unix-only code in the clients (feat-cmux-next e98b689d646):

| File | What is Unix-only |
| --- | --- |
| `bindings/rust/src/codec.rs` | `UnixStream` everywhere; `connect_unix_with_poll_checks`: `libc::socket(AF_UNIX)`, `FD_CLOEXEC`, `O_NONBLOCK`, `connect` with `EINPROGRESS`, poll, then blocking again |
| `bindings/rust/src/client.rs` | `socket: UnixStream`, `handler: FnOnce(UnixStream)` |
| `bindings/rust/src/raw/byte_attachment/mod.rs` | `socket: UnixStream` |
| `bindings/rust/src/resource/stream.rs` | `writer: UnixStream` |
| `bindings/rust/src/socket_hash.rs`, `resource/client.rs` | `UnixListener` in tests |
| `bindings/rust-daemon-client/src/launcher.rs` | `kill` (SIGKILL), `user_temp_dir` (macOS confstr), `is_executable` (mode bits) |

Module API (Unix and Windows behind cfg):

- `Stream`: Read + Write + Send + Sync, `try_clone`, `set_read_timeout`,
  `set_write_timeout`, `shutdown`, `set_nonblocking`, `peer_pid`. Unix:
  `std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`; Windows: `uds_windows::UnixStream` (std
  has no stable AF_UNIX on Windows). One concrete type per platform (no
  dynamic dispatch on the write path).
- `connect(path, deadline, poll_interval, check)`: the client contract that
  `codec.rs connect_unix_with_poll_checks` has today (the Unix code moves
  here unchanged). Windows: non-blocking connect (`WSAEWOULDBLOCK`) and
  `WSAPoll`; a connect thread with a deadline only if `WSAPoll` does not
  report AF_UNIX completion (to verify in the first red test).
- `connect_same_user(path, ...)`: before connecting, the socket file's
  owner SID must equal the caller's token user (Windows); Unix keeps its
  current listener check. Refusal is an error, never a fallback.
- `listen(path)`: creates the socket directory with an owner-only DACL
  (protected, no inheritance: the token user full control; nothing else)
  and the token user as owner, refuses an existing directory whose DACL or
  owner is wider, binds, then sets the socket file's owner to the token
  user (see experiment 2).
- `Listener::accept()` checks the peer: Windows `WSAIoctl
  SIO_AF_UNIX_GETPEERPID`, then `OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION)`
  and the process token: `TokenUser` SID must equal ours, and the token must
  not be sandboxed (coordinator): integrity (`TokenIntegrityLevel`) at least
  Medium, and not an AppContainer (`TokenIsAppContainer`). A Low-integrity or
  AppContainer process of the same user (a Chromium/CEF renderer) is
  refused. Otherwise the connection is closed and refused. The Unix rule
  (`getpeereid`/`SO_PEERCRED`, `peer_may_connect`: owner or root) is not
  changed; cmux-next's Unix daemon has no sandbox check (macOS App Sandbox
  peers are not told apart), and the SDK's Unix client checks no peer at
  all today (it relies on the socket directory's mode): reported, not
  changed.
- Sockets are not inherited by child processes (experiment 1).

Users of the module:

- cmux-sdk: `codec.rs`, `client.rs`, the byte attachment and the resource
  streams hold `cmux::local_socket::Stream`; nothing above the transport
  changes (no second client). The `UnixStream::pair()` tests use
  `cmux::local_socket` listeners (tests/common, mock daemon).
- cmux-tui-core: `platform/transport.rs` becomes a thin wrapper of the module
  (its `Stream` trait object stays for the server's existing users).
- cmux-daemon-client launcher: `kill` -> `TerminateProcess`; `user_temp_dir`
  -> `std::env::temp_dir()` (the daemon's base) and no `TMPDIR` pinning;
  `is_executable` -> `is_file()` and `.exe` in `resolve_binary`.

Experiments (Windows VM `cmux2-gpui-windows`, Server 2022, admin SSH, a
console program, no windows; 2026-10-07; source: manaflow-ai/cmux-gpui branch
windows-daemon-design, `scripts/windows/uds-experiment/`):

1. Inheritance: listener, connected and accepted `uds_windows` sockets have
   `HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT` clear; a child started with handle inheritance
   (`std::process::Command`) gets `WSAENOTSOCK` (10038) for each. So
   `uds_windows` sockets are not inherited; a test keeps it so.
2. Socket file owner: `GetNamedSecurityInfoW(SE_FILE_OBJECT, OWNER)` reads
   the owner of an AF_UNIX socket file (std sees it as a plain file). For an
   elevated process (High integrity) the owner is BUILTIN\Administrators
   (`S-1-5-32-544`, the token's default owner `TokenOwner`), not the token
   user, so "owner == token user" would refuse an elevated daemon's socket.
   `SetNamedSecurityInfoW(OWNER = token user)` on the socket file works
   (returns 0, the owner reads back as the user), and connects still work
   after it. Hence `listen` sets the owner of the directory and the socket
   file to the token user explicitly, and the client compares with its own
   token user. Not measured yet: a non-elevated (Medium) process, whose
   default owner is normally the user itself (to check in the gpuitest
   session).
3. Peer pid: `WSAIoctl(SIO_AF_UNIX_GETPEERPID)` (0x58000100) works on
   `uds_windows` sockets, on the accepted and the connecting side, and
   returns the peer's process id.

Tests (module, hosted `test-windows` in `cmux-tui-sdks.yml` and
`cmux-tui.yml`; red first):

- Not inherited (experiment 1 as a test); peer pid; deadline and poll checks.
- The peer check as a pure function (`peer_allowed(peer, ours)` over the
  peer's user SID, integrity level and AppContainer flag) with fake values:
  other user refused, same user Medium/High admitted, same user Low or
  Untrusted refused, AppContainer refused, SYSTEM and Administrators refused.
- A real Low-integrity peer of the same user: the test starts a child with
  a restricted token (`CreateRestrictedToken`, then `SetTokenInformation
  (TokenIntegrityLevel, Low)`, `CreateProcessAsUserW`); the listener must
  refuse it. No extra account; runs on the hosted runner and the Windows VM.
- A directory with a wider ACL (Everyone read, or an inherited ACE) and a
  directory owned by another SID: `listen` refuses both; a socket file whose
  owner is not the token user: `connect_same_user` refuses.
- A real peer of another user: no second account (coordinator: creating one
  is a host-access change). Options, in order: the pure-function test above
  (always); on the hosted Windows runner (an ephemeral admin VM) a peer
  started as LocalService through a short-lived scheduled task (an other
  SID without a new account), deleted in an `always()` step; a restricted or
  low-integrity token does not change the user SID, so it cannot stand in
  for another user. If the coordinator wants it on the Windows VM too, a
  SYSTEM scheduled task is the same method there (a decision: it is not an
  account, but it runs code as SYSTEM).

## 2. Daemon: Windows process tree, usage, foreground and cwd

From the same calls GPUI's `hovercard/resources.rs` already makes on
Windows (windows-sys, already a cmux-tui-core dependency):

- Tree: `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS)` -> (pid, parent pid,
  exe name). A parent pid can be reused: accept a child only when its
  creation time (`GetProcessTimes`) is after the parent's.
- Usage: `GetProcessTimes` (kernel + user, 100 ns units) and
  `K32GetProcessMemoryInfo` (`PrivateWorkingSetSize`, else `PrivateUsage`),
  with `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION`.
- Foreground: ConPTY has no foreground process group. Heuristic (coordinator
  decision, documented as one): the newest live descendant of the
  terminal's shell by creation time, skipping `conhost.exe` /
  `OpenConsole.exe`; the shell itself when it has none.
  (cmux-next's macOS/Linux use `tcgetpgrp`; the GPUI Ghostty fork reports
  the shell's pid on Windows.) Name: `QueryFullProcessImageNameW`.
- Cwd: the process's PEB: `NtQueryInformationProcess(ProcessBasicInformation)`,
  then `ReadProcessMemory` of `ProcessParameters` (PEB + 0x20) and
  `CurrentDirectory.DosPath` (+0x38 length, +0x40 buffer; 64-bit layout).
  WOW64 (32-bit) processes: no cwd in v1 (coordinator decision); detected
  with `IsWow64Process2` and reported as unknown, documented.
- Access rule (coordinator): read another process's PEB only for processes
  the daemon started, same user, same session; refuse all others. Checks, on
  one handle opened once (no pid reuse between check and read):
  1. Started by the daemon: every terminal's child tree runs in a Job Object
     the daemon creates per terminal (CreateJobObjectW +
     AssignProcessToJobObject right after spawn, before the shell runs
     user code; children inherit the job). `IsProcessInJob(handle, job)`
     must be true. (Job Objects are the reliable "started by" proof;
     parent pids are not.)
  2. Same user: the process token's `TokenUser` SID equals the daemon's.
  3. Same session: `ProcessIdToSessionId` equals the daemon's session.
  Any failed check: no cwd, no name, no usage for that process, logged once
  per pid at debug level. `terminal-resources` sums only processes that
  pass 1-3.
- Then `reads_process_trees()` is true on Windows and `terminal-resources`,
  the snapshot cwd and the foreground name work as on Linux.
- Tests (cmux-tui-core, `test-windows`): tree order (root then breadth
  first, as `cmux_next_process_tree_lists_root_then_descendants_breadth_first`),
  pid-reuse guard, PEB cwd of a spawned child in a known directory, and the
  refusals: a same-user process outside the job (the test runner itself),
  a process in the job whose token differs (skipped when the runner cannot
  create one), and a different session (the predicate with a fake session
  id). Each refusal returns no cwd and no usage.

## 3. Windows tree artifact (with hq-ed)

Windows binaries publish only when signed, or when the coordinator decides
unsigned is OK: raised with the coordinator before any publish.

- Publish `cmux-tui-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe` (+ `cmux-app-host` if built)
  and `.sha256` in every new tree, the same publish path as Linux; remove the
  `--forbid-artifact` lines for it and add `--require-artifact`.
- `pin-cmux-tui.sh host_tree_target`: `MINGW*/MSYS*/CYGWIN*` and Windows
  x86_64 -> `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.
- GPUI: `scripts/fetch-cmux-tui.sh` already uses `pin-cmux-tui.sh fetch` and
  `path` for non-macOS targets and checks the published `.sha256`;
  `scripts/build-windows.ps1` bundles the binary beside `cmux2.exe`
  (fetched on the build host, or from a Mac with
  `CMUX_TUI_TREE_TARGET=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`).

## 4. GPUI app changes (after 1-3)

- `apps/cmux2/Cargo.toml`: cmux-daemon-client and cmux-daemon-layout for all
  targets; `daemon_off.rs` goes; `daemon_binary.rs` looks for
  `cmux-tui.exe`.
- Terminals: the Linux mirror (`native/offscreen/mirror.rs`, the shared
  `daemon/terminal_mirror.rs` and `daemon/output_queue.rs`) serves Windows
  unchanged (same offscreen surfaces); `native/mod.rs` routes Windows daemon
  tabs to it.
- Client identity `device_kind`: as Linux (decision pending: a desktop kind).

## 5. Test plan

- No test runs on Lawrence's laptop.
- SDK: `cmux-tui-sdks.yml` `test-windows` (unit, socket, conformance against
  a daemon built in the job). Daemon: `cmux-tui.yml` `test-windows` gains
  the process tests above. Freestyle has no Windows VMs today.
- GPUI on the Windows VM, only in the `gpuitest` session (scheduled task,
  principal gpuitest, Interactive, Limited; RDP from the Linux VM's private
  display; logoff only with `scripts/windows/logoff-gpuitest.sh` after an
  exact name and id match):
  1. `scripts/windows/daemon-terminal-test.ps1` (port of
     `scripts/daemon-terminal-test.sh`): private session
     (`CMUX2_DAEMON=1`, `CMUX2_DAEMON_SESSION=dt-<pid>`), scratch data dir and
     settings file; scenario quit (type, quit, the CLI reads the screen, a
     second launch reattaches the same terminal with its scrollback);
     scenario restart (`server stop` under the running app, new daemon pid,
     every terminal reattaches, later input reaches the same terminal);
     `server stop --end-terminals` at the end and no process of the session
     left (by exact pid).
  2. Hover card: CPU, memory and folder from `terminal-resources` for a
     terminal running `ping -t` in a known folder.
  3. A window capture by HWND (PrintWindow) of a daemon terminal.
- Gates: `scripts/check.sh --target windows`, GPUI unit tests on the VM.

## Decisions

Taken (coordinator, 2026-10-07): one transport, folded into cmux-sdk (`local-socket` feature); no cwd
for 32-bit processes in v1; foreground = newest live descendant (a
heuristic); Job Object per terminal with `IsProcessInJob` on one handle;
`test-windows` jobs; no new Windows account.

Also taken: the real other-user peer test runs on the hosted Windows runner
only (no SYSTEM or LocalService tasks on the shared VM); the socket owner is
always our token user (`listen` sets it); signing is raised before the
artifact step; peers below Medium integrity or in an AppContainer are
refused.

Open: none for steps 1-2.
