> Moved from https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/15570 and resynced with main at 3b15ee455cb (#17256). History and authorship are in those PRs. Lines that start with "cmux-next:" mark where cmux-next differs from main. The runtime JS now lives in cmux-tui/crates/cmux-browser-host/js and the suite in tests/browser-parity; paths that name Sources/Panels/BrowserRepl, CmuxBrowser/Repl or TerminalController refer to the legacy Swift app in #15570 (cmux-next homes: browser-host.md).

# Browser driver protocol

The contract between the REPL runtime (JavaScript, engine-neutral) and an engine
driver. The runtime builds its API on these primitives the same way Playwright
builds its API on a browser protocol. Drivers:

- `webkit`: cmux app, `WKWebView` panes (Swift).
- `chromium`: CDP passthrough, when a Chromium engine lands.
- `dev`: Playwright WebKit (tests/browser-parity/lib/dev-driver.mjs), used to
  develop the runtime without an app build.

## Transport

`driver.call(method, params) -> Promise<result>` and `driver.on(event, handler)`.
In the app, calls are synchronous-looking JSON messages between the REPL's
JavaScriptCore context and Swift; results are JSON. Errors are
`{ code, message }`, with codes `not_found`, `stale`, `timeout`,
`unsupported`, `invalid`, `closed`, `blocked`, `hibernated` and `crashed`
(see [Hibernated and crashed tabs](#hibernated-and-crashed-tabs)), and the
host's `cancelled` (FETCH-CANCEL-CODE, 2026-10-05): a fetch the host stopped,
because the cell that started it timed out (message, classic's text: "fetch:
cancelled because the cell that started it timed out") or its session ended
("fetch: the session ended"). Compatibility: readers treat a code they do not
know as an error with that code and its message (the runtime compares code
strings; the Rust `ErrorCode` decodes an unknown code as `Unknown`), so an
older reader of `cancelled` still reports the error and its message.

Coordinates are CSS pixels relative to the top-left of the tab's viewport
(main frame), matching Playwright `page.mouse` and screenshots at scale 1.

## Tabs

| Method | Params | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tabs.list` | `{ all? }` | `[{ targetId, title, url, active, windowId, state, dataStore, openerTargetId?, incognito? }]` in window order (`state`: `live`, `hibernated`, `waking` or `crashed`; listing never wakes a tab); with `all`, then the browser tabs of every other workspace and window (`windowId` names the workspace). Any listed tab is a valid `targetId` for the other methods. Tabs with equal `dataStore` (an opaque id, never reused for another store) share cookies and storage; a hibernated tab not yet loaded since a relaunch has none |
| `tabs.dataStore` | `{ targetId? }` | `{ dataStore }`: the store `cookies.get` uses with the same params |
| `tabs.open` | `{ url?, background?, dataStore?, incognito? }` | `{ targetId }`; resolves after commit of `url`. With `dataStore`, the tab opens in that store (and the profile of a tab that uses it); one no reachable tab uses fails with `invalid`. With `incognito: true`, the tab opens in a store that keeps nothing (see "Incognito"); a driver without one fails with `unsupported` and opens nothing |
| `tabs.close` | `{ targetId, runBeforeUnload?, timeoutMs?, reason? }` | `reason` is `"session_end"` only when the browser host closes a tab at the session's end (with `timeoutMs`); the app then closes it with raw `close-tabs {reason: "session_end"}` (`close-reason-v1`), so the close is not in Reopen Closed. An agent's own `tabs.close` carries no reason (the host removes one an agent sends); the app provider closes no tab for it (tabs belong to the person's layout) |
| `tabs.activate` | `{ targetId }` | |
| `tab.navigate` | `{ targetId, url, waitUntil: "commit"\|"domcontentloaded"\|"load"\|"networkidle", timeoutMs }` | `{ url, status? }` |
| `tab.history` | `{ targetId, delta: -1\|1, waitUntil, timeoutMs }` | `{ url }`, or `null` when no entry (the blank page a tab opened on is not an entry) |
| `tab.reload` | `{ targetId, waitUntil, timeoutMs }` | `{ status? }` |
| `tab.info` | `{ targetId }` | `{ url, title, state, loadState, viewport: { width, height }, deviceScaleFactor, webProcessId?, closedRoots?, unroutedEvents? }`; `unroutedEvents` (shared headless, user origin only) lists the host's log entries of the tab's events no session took (D2); `closedRoots: { walks, walkMs, roots, domEvents }` (CDP engines) is the cost of finding closed shadow roots in the tab, for the perf bench. Measured on the Testbox (2026-10-06): one walk about 250 ms on cards-50k and table-10k, 58 ms on list-5k, 19 ms on wikipedia and github, 9 ms per out-of-process frame. After a walk the DOM domain stays on until 12,000 DOM events or the first event more than 30 s after the walk (DOM_EVENT_BUDGET, DOM_IDLE_AFTER_READ; a churning page sends about 6,400 events/s); review a change of either constant against these numbers |
| `tab.setViewport` | `{ targetId, width, height }` or `{ targetId, reset: true }` | |
| `tab.bringToFront` | `{ targetId }` | |
| `tab.keep` | `{ targetId }` | |
| `tab.handleEvents` | `{ targetId, events: ["dialog"\|"filechooser"\|"download"] }` | Replaces the events this session has a handler for in the tab. See below. |
| `session.name` | `{ name }` | |
| `session.configure` | `{ userAgent?, extraHTTPHeaders?, permissions?, proxy?, incognito? }`, each key replacing its value (`null` clears) | `{ proxy, incognito }`: whether tabs opened from now on use the proxy, and whether they open incognito. Applies to the tabs the session created while it is attached (a user's tab it drives keeps its own user agent, headers and content), whichever session drives them; it is undone when the creating session leaves the tab. Content rules are not accepted here: the driver builds them from the session's domain policy (see "Guards") |
| `history.search` | `{ queries?, from?, to?, limit }` (times in ms since the epoch) | `[{ url, title, dateVisited }]` newest first, from the history of the profiles the workspace's tabs use |

Tabs the session opened (`tabs.open`, popups of those tabs) close when the session ends
(`tabs.close` with `reason: "session_end"`, left out of Reopen Closed);
`tab.keep` releases one so it stays open.

A tab the session created (`tabs.open`, and popups of such a tab) gets the
session's behaviors while the session is attached: `dialog.opened`,
`filechooser.opened` and `download.*` for every dialog, file chooser and
download, permission requests answered from `session.configure`, and no
insecure-HTTP prompt. Any other tab the session drives is the user's: those
events keep the browser's own UI and are not sent, except an event named in
the session's last `tab.handleEvents` for that tab, which is sent to the
sessions instead. The runtime sends `tab.handleEvents` whenever a page's
`dialog`, `filechooser` or `download` listeners change, and its next call on
the tab waits for it. A download keeps the route it started with.

A dialog or file chooser the page opens while it handles a session's
`input.*` call, the first second of its page-world `frame.evaluate` (the
runtime's own agent-world reads hold nothing), its `tab.navigate`,
`tab.reload` or `tab.history` until the navigation commits, or while a call
wakes the tab,
is sent to that session too, also in a user's tab (the call caused it, so
cmux's own dialog or Open panel must not come up in front of the user, and
the call must not wait for an answer only the user can give); downloads
keep the user's location.

Each such event goes to one session, never to every session driving the
tab: a session with a handler for it in its last `tab.handleEvents` (the
creating session's first, then the session that registered first), else the
creating session of a tab a session created, else, for a dialog or file
chooser, the session whose call the page is handling. Only that session gets
`dialog.opened`, `filechooser.opened` and the download's `download.*` events,
and `dialog.respond` and `filechooser.respond` from any other session fail
with `not_found`, leaving the dialog or chooser open. When that session
leaves the tab, its open dialogs are dismissed and its choosers cancelled.

cmux-next shared headless browser (D2, ff 2026-10-06): headless has no user
UI, so an event no session takes is answered by the host (a dialog is
dismissed, `beforeunload` keeps the page; a chooser is cancelled; a download
is cancelled) and logged. The entry `{ url, reason, blocked: "unrouted",
event, targetId, action, at }` (no page text) goes to the policy log
(`policy log`, `session.blockedNavigations()`) of the session that opened the
tab, also after it kept the tab (a popup counts as its opener's tab), while
that session is attached; and to the host's own log of the newest 64
entries, which only the person (user origin) reads, as `tab.info
unroutedEvents` (that tab's entries) on a tab they may use. Engine or app
events named `host.policyLog` are dropped: only the host writes that log.

cmux-next shared headless browser, clipboard (item 19): Copy, Cut and Paste
never use the browser's clipboard (the system's, or the X11 one of a headful
browser on Xvfb). The driver records the shortcut's `keydown` (a prevented
one runs no command), then sends the page a `copy`, `cut` or `paste` event
with a `DataTransfer` in the focused frame and does the default action
itself: the selection's text to the tab's clipboard, a cut's deletion, a
paste's `text/plain` through `Input.insertText` (trusted `input`). These
clipboard events are untrusted (`isTrusted` false), as the agent's paste is by
design. A Copy or Cut the page has not finished within 5 s fails with
`timeout` and its late result is dropped; the tab's web content process is
not ended, because no clipboard outside the tab can be written (an
intentional cmux-next difference from WebKit). Page script never reaches
the browser's clipboard either: the page clipboard guard
(`js/page-clipboard.js`, through the page-world binding `__cmuxPageClipboard`,
which it removes before any page script runs) is installed at document start
in every frame, script-made `about:blank` frames included, so the page's
`navigator.clipboard` and `execCommand("copy" | "cut")` write the tab's
clipboard; the browser refuses the clipboard permissions (`clipboard-read`,
`clipboard-write`, sanitized or not) in every store, for a document or world
the guard does not reach; and raw `cdp` refuses an `Input.dispatchKeyEvent`
with a copy, cut or paste editing command.

cmux-next shared headless browser, background tabs (chief, 2026-10-06): a tab
an agent session drove (any call on it) or opened in the last 30 s runs at
full rate; every other tab (kept tabs, tabs of sessions that went quiet) is
throttled with `Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate` 4 (Chromium's low-end
setting), and its next call puts it back to full rate first. The host has no
timer for this (zero idle work): tabs cool down at the next call on any tab.
The parity runner closes the tabs each scenario leaves open, so a host reused
across scenarios does not pile them up.

cmux-next shared browser, file choosers (items 10/11): a headless browser
intercepts the file choosers of every tab (no person can see an Open panel),
so D2 applies to all of them. A headful browser (`CMUX_BROWSER_HOST_HEADLESS=0`,
for example on Xvfb, which a person may use) intercepts only the tabs a
session created or drives, from the session's first call on the tab until
the last session leaves it; a person's own tab keeps the browser's Open
panel and is never cancelled. Interception is turned on after a tab's or
frame's setup has resumed it, so a chooser the page opens in the first
moments of a new document (before that call lands) can still reach the
browser's own panel (headless: none is shown; headful: the person's panel).
A popup of a session's tab on a headful browser intercepts from the first
session call on it.

cmux-next shared headless browser, `session.configure` (item 4d): the user
agent and extra headers are set per tab before its first request (a popup
starts with its opener's) on the tabs the session created and did not keep;
`tab.keep` and the session's end restore the browser's own. `proxy` opens a
private browser context (its own cookie jar, starting with a one-way copy of
the profile's cookies, like every store a session makes) for the tabs the
session opens afterwards, popups included. Its tabs list the dataStore
`<profile>/proxy-<n>` (stable while the store is open); the session's
`cookies.*` without `targetId` use it, and with `targetId` the tab's own
store. It closes at the session's end unless a tab in it (a popup too) was
kept, then at host exit. Known gap: proxy credentials answer `unsupported`
(they need `Fetch.authRequired`). Range rule (the gate, every engine;
browser-egress.md 7.3): a proxied response reports the PROXY's address
(Chromium 143, measured), so the after-the-fact rebinding check cannot see
where the proxy went, and a page behind it loads and is readable before a
stop. So a remote (relay) session's `proxy` is `forbidden`; a proxy's own
address meets the range rule, by literal and by this machine's resolver
(link-local and metadata refused to every session; a `proxyServer` the gate
cannot read is refused); and while a session's new tabs use a proxy, a
navigation or fetch URL whose name this machine resolves into a refused range
is refused before dispatch. A name that resolves only at the proxy is the
proxy's to check (cmux exits will enforce the rule at the exit; vendor exits
are an accepted risk). Page-made requests in a proxied tab and kept proxied
tabs another session drives are not checked by name (known gap until the
exit enforces it). `permissions` (chief, 2026-10-06, option
2): CDP grants per browser context, never per tab, so the session's new tabs
open in a private store (`<profile>/private-<n>`, or its proxy store) that
holds the grants; no grant reaches a person's tab. A private store starts
with a one-way copy of the profile's cookies (never written back), and closes
like a proxy store. Clipboard grants are refused (`forbidden`); `null` or `[]`
drops the grants and new tabs open in the profile again (a proxy store keeps
them). A proxy set after permissions gets the same grants and the same cookie
copy.

Incognito (private data P1, ff 2026-10-06). `tabs.open {incognito: true}`,
and every `tabs.open` of a session after `session.configure {incognito:
true}` (the app sets it for an incognito workspace), opens the tab in the
session's incognito store. On the shared headless browser that is an
in-memory browser context (Chromium keeps contexts it creates off the
record: no disk cache, no persistent cookies) with no cookie of the profile
(no copy in, nothing written back), named `<profile>/incognito-<n>`; its
tabs and their popups list `incognito: true`. An incognito tab is never
kept (`tab.keep` fails with `forbidden`) and never restored; the store
closes when the session ends. No page visit of an incognito tab is recorded
in history. In an incognito session `tabs.open {incognito: false}` fails
with `forbidden`, tab-less `cookies.*` use the incognito store, and a
tab-less `net.fetch` fails with `unsupported` (its hidden shell runs in the
profile's store). Known gap: incognito with a proxy or permission grants is
`unsupported`. App tabs (CEF, WebKit) answer `unsupported` until the app
opens them in its non-persistent store; never a persistent tab.

Permission names are Playwright's. The classic column is what the classic
WebKit backend (the dev driver's Playwright WebKit) accepts; a name not known
to work there is `unsupported` on WebKit.

| Name | Headless Chromium (CDP) | Classic WebKit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `geolocation` | `geolocation` | supported |
| `notifications` | `notifications` | supported |
| `camera` | `videoCapture` | unsupported |
| `microphone` | `audioCapture` | unsupported |
| `midi`, `midi-sysex` | `midi`, `midiSysex` | unsupported |
| `background-sync` | `backgroundSync` | unsupported |
| `ambient-light-sensor`, `accelerometer`, `gyroscope`, `magnetometer` | `sensors` | unsupported |
| `payment-handler` | `paymentHandler` | unsupported |
| `storage-access` | `storageAccess` | unsupported |
| `local-fonts` | `localFonts` | unsupported |
| `idle-detection` | `idleDetection` | unsupported |
| `window-management` | `windowManagement` | unsupported |
| `screen-wake-lock` | `wakeLockScreen` | unsupported |
| `clipboard-read`, `clipboard-write` | refused (`forbidden`) | unsupported |

When the last session leaves a tab, the driver releases what the sessions
left pressed: each held key gets its key-up (last pressed first) and each
held mouse button its button-up at the last mouse position, or the drag it
started ends. The page sees them as trusted events. `session.name` shows the tabs the
session opened, now and later, as `<name> · <page title>`, following title
changes; a title the user set wins, and the plain title returns when the
session ends. An empty name removes the label.

Hidden tabs a session drives render at 1280x800 (Playwright's default); a tab
shown in a visible pane keeps its pane size; `tab.setViewport` overrides both.
While driven, a hidden tab's window reports key and its web view is first
responder there, so the page is focused (`document.hasFocus()`, focus and blur
events) without changing the user's key window or first responder.

`tab.info.url` is the live document URL, including `history.pushState` changes.

No driver method moves the user's focus or selection except
`tabs.activate` and `tab.bringToFront`, which select the tab in its pane
(`tabs.open` adds the tab behind the pane's selected tab), and
`auth.request`, whose sheet names the tab and workspace that ask. While
`input.key` runs, WebKit's request to move AppKit focus out of the page
(`_webView:takeFocus:`, Tab past the last control) is refused, so the focus
stays in the web view and the window's first responder stays the user's.
A key-down no page handles is not passed on: WebKit resends such a key
through `NSApp.sendEvent` to the key window (the user's terminal, menus), so
keys the REPL and `cmux browser press` send carry a mark (`eventSourceUserData`; the mobile browser stream's keys, a person's, do not) and the app
drops a marked key that arrives outside the web view's own delivery.

## Hibernated and crashed tabs

A tab a relaunch restored but no pane has shown yet lists as `hibernated`
too; the first call on it creates its browser, which then wakes the same
way. Every call with a `targetId` except `tabs.close`, `tab.keep`,
`tab.navigate` and `tab.history` first wakes a hibernated tab
(the driver starts the restore of the page cmux unloaded, off screen) and
waits, at most 30 s on the injected clock, until the restore commits and
the document reaches `DOMContentLoaded`. Then the call runs. On a crashed
tab (web content process ended, Reload offered in the pane) every call but
`tabs.close`, `tab.keep`, `tab.navigate`, `tab.reload`, `tab.history`,
`tab.info`, `tabs.activate`, `tab.bringToFront` and `tab.handleEvents`
fails at once. `tab.reload` on a crashed tab loads the page in a new web
content process (as the pane's Reload does) and waits for it like a wake;
on a hibernated tab the wake is the reload. A hidden tab whose process
ended is restored like a hibernated one. Errors, where `<tab>` is `tab <id> ("<title>", <url>)`:

| Condition | Code | Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crashed | `crashed` | `<method>: <tab> crashed: its web content process ended (a WebKit crash, or macOS reclaimed its memory). Call page.reload() or page.goto(url) to load it again; until then only navigation, tab.info and page.close() work on it` |
| The user stopped the tab from loading | `hibernated` | `<method>: <tab> is hibernated (cmux unloaded it to save memory while it was hidden) and the user stopped it from loading, so cmux does not load it again on its own. Call page.reload() to load it, then retry` |
| The restore ended without a page | `hibernated` | `<method>: <tab> is hibernated (cmux unloaded it to save memory while it was hidden) and loading it again did not finish with a page. Call page.reload() to load it, then retry` |
| Still loading after 30 s | `timeout` | `<method>: <tab> was hibernated (cmux unloaded it to save memory while it was hidden) and did not load again within 30 s, so the call did not run. It is still loading: retry the call, or call page.reload()` |

## Frames and scripts

| Method | Params | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (world `host`) | cmux-next: `frame.evaluate` also takes `world: "host"`, a content world only the browser host uses (no page agent); the host refuses it from agent code | |
| `frames.list` | `{ targetId }` | `[{ frameId, parentFrameId, url, name, crossOrigin }]`, parents before children, document order |
| `frame.evaluate` | `{ targetId, frameId, world: "agent"\|"page", source, args, awaitPromise, timeoutMs }` | JSON-serializable return value |
| `frame.ownerBox` | `{ targetId, frameId }` | owner `<iframe>` content box in parent-frame coordinates |
| `frame.focused` | `{ targetId }` | `{ frameId, url }` of the frame that holds keyboard focus, or `null`; host only (the gate refuses it from sessions). The host asks it when its focus probe for secret typing cannot look into a cross-origin frame; a driver without it answers an error and the secret is refused |

`world: "agent"` runs in an isolated content world where the driver has
already installed the page agent (`cmux-tui/crates/cmux-browser-host/js/page-agent.js`) and
Playwright's injected script. Cross-origin frames are reachable. `source` is a
function expression called with `args`. The agent world survives until the
frame navigates; after navigation the driver reinstalls it before the next call.

## Input

All input is delivered as native, trusted events (`isTrusted === true`).

| Method | Params |
| --- | --- |
| `input.mouse` | `{ targetId, type: "move"\|"down"\|"up"\|"wheel", x, y, button: "left"\|"right"\|"middle", clickCount, modifiers, deltaX?, deltaY? }` |
| `input.key` | `{ targetId, type: "down"\|"up", key, code, text?, location?, modifiers, autoRepeat? }` |
| `input.insertText` | `{ targetId, text }` or, from the runtime, `{ targetId, secret: name }`, which the native session turns into `{ targetId, text, secretName, secretDomains }` (see "Guards") (IME commit into the focused element. On WebKit a `contenteditable` editor gets marked text then its confirmation, so `compositionstart`, `beforeinput`/`input` and `compositionend` fire, trusted, and editors that start an edit only on a keydown or a composition (Google Sheets) take it; a form field gets a plain insert with one `input` event, as Chrome's `Input.insertText`; text with a line break or tab, or focus in an unreadable frame, inserts without a composition) |
| `input.drag` | `{ targetId, path: [{ x, y }], button, modifiers }` (native drag session so HTML5 drag and drop fires). The drag's data goes to a private pasteboard of that drag, never the system's named drag pasteboard: around each move that may start the drag, WebKit's lookups of the drag pasteboard get the private one until WebKit starts the drag, the move is handled or 5 s pass. One drag holds that window at a time across all tabs (WebKit's lookups do not say which web view they serve); a move that cannot get it within 5 s fails with `timeout` and is not delivered. A drag WebKit starts after its window closed drops no data. A person's drag in another web view during the window gets the private pasteboard too |

On Chromium (CDP driver) `input.drag` turns on drag interception
(`Input.setInterceptDrags`) for the call: the press and the moves are
trusted mouse events; when the page starts a drag, Chromium hands its data
to the driver (`Input.dragIntercepted`) instead of the system, and the
driver sends `dragenter`, `dragover` at each further point and `drop` at
the last one (`Input.dispatchDragEvent`). The drag's data never reaches a
system pasteboard. After a drop the page gets no `mouseup`, as with a drag
the system runs; a path that starts no drag ends with a plain release.

`modifiers` is an array of `Alt`, `Control`, `Meta`, `Shift`. Key names follow
Playwright (`KeyboardEvent.key` values plus `Meta+a` style parsed by the runtime).

When sessions share a tab, a session's `input.mouse` `down` owns the pointer
until its `up` (or until the session leaves the tab), and an `input.drag`
owns it from its press to its release; another session's `input.mouse` or
`input.drag` waits meanwhile, at most 10 s, then fails with `timeout`
naming the session that holds the mouse.

## Capture

| Method | Params | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tab.screenshot` | `{ targetId, clip?, fullPage?, format: "png"\|"jpeg"\|"webp", quality? }` (the session adds `secretMasks`) | `{ base64, width, height }` |
| `tab.pdf` | `{ targetId, format?, width?, height?, landscape?, printBackground?, margin? }` | `{ base64 }` |

Captures of one tab run one at a time; a capture waits for the tab's
other capture within its own timeout. Chromium answers overlapping
`Page.captureScreenshot` calls of one page with the wrong region (a
clipped capture changes the page's emulation while it runs). The host's
secret mask hides the fields that hold a secret before a capture and
checks them after it. The check uses the secrets the tab has after the
capture, so a secret that another session types into the tab during the
capture (it is recorded for the tab before its input is sent) refuses the
capture.

## Files, dialogs, popups, downloads

| Method | Params |
| --- | --- |
| `input.setFiles` | `{ targetId, frameId, element: <agent element handle id>, files: [{ name, mimeType, base64 }] }` |
| `filechooser.respond` | `{ targetId, chooserId, files }` or `{ ..., cancel: true }` |
| `dialog.respond` | `{ targetId, dialogId, accept, promptText? }` |
| `download.path` | `{ downloadId }` → `{ path }` after completion |

## Events

Every event carries `targetId`.

| Event | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| `tab.created` | `{ targetId, openerTargetId?, url }` (popups and `target=_blank`) |
| `tab.closed` | |
| `tab.crashed` | (the web content process ended; calls other than navigation fail until a reload or navigation starts a new one) |
| `tab.replaced` | (cmux gave the tab a new web view: it restored a page it had unloaded to save memory, or recovered a crashed one; frame ids and element handles from before are gone) |
| `tab.navigated` | `{ frameId, url, sameDocument }` |
| `navigation.blocked` | `{ url, reason }`: the driver cancelled a main-frame navigation of a tab the session created because the domain policy blocks `url` (cmux-next: the host blocks the document before its request is sent and keeps the entry in its policy log) |
| `tab.loadState` | `{ state: "domcontentloaded"\|"load"\|"networkidle" }` |
| `dialog.opened` | `{ dialogId, type: "alert"\|"confirm"\|"prompt"\|"beforeunload", message, defaultValue, dismissedDuring? }` (stays open until `dialog.respond`; with `dismissedDuring: "copy"\|"cut"\|"paste"` it opened during that clipboard command and is already dismissed) |
| `filechooser.opened` | `{ chooserId, frameId, element, multiple }` (the native panel is not shown; see `tab.handleEvents` for which tabs send it) |
| `download.started` | `{ downloadId, url, suggestedFilename }` |
| `download.finished` | `{ downloadId, path?, error? }` |
| `console` | `{ type, text, args?, location? }` |
| `pageerror` | `{ message, stack }` |
| `request` / `response` / `requestfailed` / `requestfinished` | `{ requestId, url, method, resourceType, status?, headers? }` |

## Browser state

| Method | Params |
| --- | --- |
| `cookies.get` / `cookies.set` | `{ urls?, targetId? }`, `{ cookies, targetId? }`. They use the store of the target tab (a private tab's, or the session's proxy store, is not the user's profile), which the runtime names on every call a page makes; without `targetId`, the session's `session.configure({ proxy })` store, else the active tab's. A URL the domain policy blocks fails with `blocked`; `cookies.get` leaves out the cookies of blocked sites and `cookies.set` refuses one, and also refuses a cookie with a Domain attribute (`.example.com`) unless an allowed pattern covers every subdomain it reaches (`*.example.com`) and no prohibited host is among them (see "Guards") |
| `cookies.clear` | `{ targetId?, all?, name?, domain?, path? }`. Deletes the cookies of the target tab's store (without `targetId`, the store `cookies.get` uses) on that tab's site, its registrable domain by the system's Public Suffix List (CFNetwork), and the site's subdomains, narrowed by exact `name`, `domain` and `path`. The driver takes the site from the tab; a `site` parameter is ignored. On a persistent profile (the user's cookies) a tab with no http(s) site and `all: true` fail with `invalid`; a store that is not persistent (a private tab's, the session's proxy store) is cleared whole for either. Cookies of sites the domain policy blocks are never cleared. Answers `{ cleared, restoreId }`: on the host's own browsers (headless) every clear is undoable (private data P2; Lawrence via ff, 2026-10-07). The cookies it deletes are written first to `<state>/cookie-backups/<id>.bin` (mode 0600, directory 0700; `<state>` = `$CMUX_BROWSER_HOST_STATE_DIR`, else `$XDG_STATE_HOME/cmux/browser-host`, `~/.local/state/cmux/browser-host`, or `~/Library/Application Support/cmux/browser-host` on macOS), encrypted with XChaCha20-Poly1305 under a 32-byte key in the separate 0600 file `<state>/cookie-backup.key`, the id as associated data; no backup, no clear. `restoreId` is `host:<32 hex>` (`null` when nothing matched). A backup is kept until it is restored, the person purges it, or every cookie in it has passed its own expiry (checked lazily at each clear, restore and listing; a session cookie keeps it). Engines that keep no backup (CEF and WebKit providers until the app's profile owner does) answer no `restoreId`. The host also answers `site`. Bound: at most 50 backups or 64 MiB of backup files per state directory, whichever comes first; a clear that would pass it fails with `forbidden` ("cookie backups are full ...; restore a backup ... or ask the person to purge backups") before any cookie is deleted, and no older backup is ever dropped to make room. The key file sits next to the backups, so the encryption protects a backup copied away alone, not against a local attacker running as the same user; an OS-held key (Keychain, Secret Service) is a later choice for the app's profile owner (bead cx-pp5). Logging: every clear and restore that succeeds gets one entry `{ op, site, cookies, restoreId, targetId?, at }` (restore adds `kept`, `expired`; never a cookie value) in the session's policy log (policy op `log`; `session.blockedNavigations()` shows only entries with `blocked`), one `browser.privateData` session event (`{ v: 1, session_id, ...entry }`, the `browser.*` kind of the Agent activity event schema; the app does not read it yet) and the host's private-data log with `session` (newest 1,000), which `browser.cookieBackups.list` answers as `log` |
| `cookies.restore` | `{ restoreId }`. Puts the backed-up cookies back in the store they came from (`invalid` when that store is closed or the backup is gone). A cookie set since the clear with the same name, domain and path is kept, not overwritten; a cookie past its expiry is left out. Answers `{ restored, kept, expired }` and deletes the backup. The REPL's `context.clearCookies()` returns `{ restoreIds }` and `context.restoreCookies(idOrIdsOrResult)` undoes it |
| `browser.cookieBackups.list` / `browser.cookieBackups.purge` (host catalog ops, not driver methods) | User origin only (the origin comes from the connection); every other origin gets `forbidden` ("only the person (user origin) manages cookie backups"), so an agent cannot delete the undo of what it cleared. `list` answers `{ backups: [{ restoreId, site, cookies, createdAt }] }` with no cookie values. `purge { restoreId } | { all: true }` without `confirm` deletes nothing and answers `{ confirm, backups, deleted: 0 }`: a one-time token for exactly that request, valid for two minutes; the same request with `confirm` deletes and answers `{ deleted }`. A token for another request, a used or an expired one is `invalid`. A purge that deletes writes `{ op: "cookieBackups.purge", restoreIds, deleted, actor, origin, at }` to the host's private-data log (a purge has no session, so this log only the person reads is its only record); `list` also answers `log`, that log's entries |
| `clipboard.read` / `clipboard.write` | per-tab virtual clipboard `{ items: [{ type, base64 }] }`. Meta+C, Meta+X and Meta+V run the engine's own Copy, Cut and Paste against it, so the page gets trusted `copy`, `cut` and `paste` events with `clipboardData` (every type), and the system clipboard is neither read nor written. They run only in tabs a session created: in a user's tab `input.key` refuses them with `unsupported` before any key reaches the page. Until the engine reports the command done, a JavaScript dialog in that tab is answered as an unhandled one is (`dialog.respond` with `accept: false`) and reported with `dismissedDuring`, never held. On WebKit, which has no per-view pasteboard, the general-pasteboard lookups WebKit itself makes (its pasteboard IPC answered through WebCore) get a private pasteboard from the start of one command until WebKit reports it done or 5 s pass; lookups by any other code, `NSPasteboard.general` included, get the system pasteboard. The tab's clipboard takes the private pasteboard only when the command finished in time. At 5 s the driver ends the tab's web content process (`tab.crashed`) in the same main-thread turn that ends the redirect, and the call fails with `timeout`: WebKit handles no message from that process afterwards, so a Copy or Cut the page would finish late never writes the system clipboard. It ends the process only when every other tab in it was created by the same session and no popup window of cmux's shares it (popups share their opener's process); otherwise the shortcut falls back to script (the selection's text, or inserting the clipboard's text, without clipboard events). A session that detaches, or a tab that closes, during the command does not change that. If another tab or a popup window joins the process during a command, the private pasteboard stays until WebKit finishes or 5 s more pass, when the driver ends the process anyway (its pages crash). A caller that stops waiting shortens none of these times. A Paste also runs through WebKit only while the private pasteboard's change count is below the system's, so WebKit's read grant, which compares change counts, can never cover the system clipboard; otherwise it falls back to inserting text. Commands run one at a time across all tabs, because WebKit's pasteboard requests do not say which web view they serve, so two tabs' commands at once would share one private pasteboard. For the same reason a copy in another web view during a command (a person's, or a page's in a user's tab) reaches the private pasteboard; WebKit's own Copy or Cut writes it at most once and a Paste never, so a command whose pasteboard was written more often fails with `stale` and leaves the tab's clipboard unchanged (the one copy it cannot tell apart is the only write of a Copy or Cut whose page cancelled the event and set no data). A person's paste in another web view during a command still reads the private pasteboard. Items that name a local file (a file URL, also a `file:` URL as `text/uri-list` or another URL type, a filename list, an alias, a Finder node or a file promise) are left out when the tab's clipboard is put on the private pasteboard for a Paste, so WebKit never hands the page a local file. A command waits up to 5 s for the one before it, which ends by then (10 s when its process could not be ended at once), then gets its own 5 s; one that cannot start fails with `timeout`, names the tab it waited for, and does not run. While a command runs, another web view's paste or copy uses the private pasteboard too. Writes a page's own scripts make (the asynchronous Clipboard API, `execCommand("copy")`) are outside this redirect; the page clipboard guard (see "Guards") sends them to this clipboard |

## Guards

Agent code runs in the REPL's JavaScriptCore context, so the guards are
native (`BrowserReplBoundary` in the session, and the driver):

cmux-next: the guards are in the Rust browser host below the QuickJS-ng VM
(`gate.rs`, `secrets.rs`, `policy.rs`; browser-host.md section 4). The
port plan (section 3) lists, per guard, whether the host has it yet.

- Secrets: values stay in the session. `input.insertText { secret }` reaches
  the driver as `{ text, secretName, secretDomains }`; the driver types it
  only when the document that holds the focused element has an origin
  matching one of `secretDomains`, else fails with `secret "x" may not be
  typed into <origin>; its domains are ...`. The origin is read in the
  driver's own content world by the same evaluation that finds the focus,
  in that document (its own origin, `null` when opaque), not from
  WebKit's frame tree, which keeps naming a frame's old document after it
  navigates. The check runs right before the
  text is committed, after the wait for the editor state (a page can move
  focus during that wait), and the marked text and insert follow on the
  same main-thread turn. A page can still move focus in its own web process
  between the check's last reply and the insert reaching that process:
  WebKit has no insert bound to an element or frame, so that cross-process
  window remains. Captures get `secretMasks
  [{ value, domains }]` (plain values, and the codes of a TOTP secret a
  server still accepts: the current window and one on each side); the
  driver masks only in frames whose document's origin is on those
  domains, and refuses the capture (`invalid`) when masking fails in one
  of them or a scan after the capture finds a value rendered unmasked.
  A frame keeps its id when it navigates, so the mask goes by documents:
  before the capture the driver marks every frame's document in its own
  content world and reads the origin there, masks only in a document
  that still holds the mark, and refuses the capture when, after it, any
  frame shows a document without the mark (it showed another page
  meanwhile).
  Results, events, fetch responses, output, errors, written files and
  files read back are redacted by the session. Another session that drives the same tab
  (`tabs.use`) does not hold the secret, so the driver remembers each value
  it typed, by tab, typing session and secret name, from when the domain
  check passes, before it types, until the tab closes (a value the check
  refuses is never remembered; sessions whose secrets share a name keep
  separate values), and masks it as typed, `<secret:name>`, in every result,
  event and error it returns to any other session, and in their captures;
  once the typing session ends, also for a later session of the same name.
  A TOTP secret's typed value is its code, masked as that literal.
  This masks the value as typed and in the encodings the session's
  redaction knows; page script that copies it elsewhere or transforms it
  is outside it, as it is within one session.
- Domain policy: the session refuses `tab.navigate`/`tabs.open` to a blocked
  URL (`blocked`) and `session.configure` content rules, and calls the
  driver's `setDomainPolicy(policy)` (Swift only). The driver applies the
  policy's content rules to the tabs the session created, refuses reads and input (`frame.evaluate`, `auth.request`,
  `frame.contentFrame(s)`, `input.*`, captures, clipboard, file chooser
  answers) on a tab that shows a blocked page, cancels main-frame
  navigations to blocked URLs in tabs the session created
  (`navigation.blocked`), and never navigates a user's tab away for the
  policy. It also judges every frame, not only the main frame, by WebKit's
  record of it (`WKFrameInfo.securityOrigin` and URL) and by its document
  (`location.origin` and `location.protocol + "//" + location.host`, read
  in the driver's own content world; `location` cannot be forged by page or
  agent script). Script the driver runs in a frame (`frame.evaluate` and
  the calls built on it, `frames.list` names, `frame.ownerBox`) first checks
  in the frame that the document is one the driver approved, and runs
  nothing in another: a frame keeps its id when it navigates, so a frame
  looked up from an earlier tree read is judged again. A frame that shows a
  blocked page fails with `blocked` (`snapshot()` marks its iframe
  `[not read: blocked by the domain policy]`). On a fresh tree read the
  driver refuses `input.mouse` and `input.drag` at a point inside the box
  of the main frame's child frame that is or holds a blocked frame (overlap
  is not subtracted, and a blocked frame whose box it cannot find refuses
  every point), `input.key` and `input.insertText` while a blocked frame
  holds the focus (its document has it or holds a focused element, or its
  parent's focused element is its frame; a frame that cannot answer counts
  as focused), PDFs while any frame shows a blocked page, and file
  chooser answers other than `cancel` when the chooser's own frame (as
  WebKit recorded it when the chooser opened, and the document it shows
  now) is blocked. A screenshot blanks, in gray, the box of each main-frame
  child frame that is or holds a blocked frame, as the tree is before and
  after the capture, and shows the rest of the page; it is refused when
  the main frame is blocked or a blocked frame's content cannot be hidden
  that way (its box is unknown, its frame element or an ancestor has
  `-webkit-box-reflect` or `filter`, or an element of the page has
  `backdrop-filter`). When a capture is prepared, the driver marks each
  frame's document in its own content world and judges the document it
  marked, the one the capture shows (a frame can navigate after the tree
  read): a PDF is refused while any marked document is blocked; a
  screenshot is refused while the main frame's is, and blanks every child
  frame whose marked document is blocked like the tree's blocked frames
  (it is refused when such a frame is missing from the tree read before
  the capture). The capture is refused when a frame shows another
  document after it. Child frames are matched to their elements through
  `window.frames`, which leaves out frames in shadow trees, so while the
  main frame has a frame in a shadow tree every box counts as unknown. In tabs the session created the content rules keep a
  blocked frame from loading at all; its empty frame belongs to the parent
  and refuses nothing. The page can still move a frame or the focus in its
  own web process between the check and the input reaching it. Each of
  these checks' own scripts (a frame's document, its focus, the frame
  boxes), each capture mask script (mark, mask, check, restore) and each
  focus probe of a secret's typing check must answer within 5 s, or the
  call fails with `stale`: WebKit
  drops a script's completion when a navigation replaces its document, and
  a busy page answers late.
- Page-opened windows: a window a page opens from a user's tab, also one
  a session drives, goes to the browser's own popup handling and never to
  a session, so no session adopts it or closes it when it ends, except one
  it opens while it handles a session's own call (as for dialogs above):
  the browser's path would put a key popup window over the user's work,
  out of the agent's reach, so that window becomes a background tab sent
  to that session alone (`tab.created` with `userOwned: true`), under the
  URL checks below with that session's policy, and stays the user's: it is
  neither labelled nor closed when the session ends. Any other window the
  page of a driven tab opens through the browser's path while the user is
  not working in that tab (it is not shown and focused in the key window
  of the active app) opens as a background tab, told to no session, never
  as a key popup window. A window
  a page opens from a tab a session created becomes a popup tab through
  cmux's own navigation, which trusts local files and cmux's internal
  schemes, and the page controls its URL. So it goes to the sessions
  (`tab.created`) only when it is an `http`, `https`, `about:blank` or
  `blob:` (of such an origin) page that the browser's URL allowlist and
  the creating session's domain policy allow; otherwise it opens nothing. When WebKit refuses to compile the policy's
  content rules, every driver call of the session fails with `invalid`
  (`the domain policy could not be applied: ...`) until the session sets a
  policy that compiles (a locked one needs a reset); the tabs keep the last
  rule list that compiled. The policy setters (`session.allowedDomains`
  and the like) return once the native session holds the policy, before
  WebKit compiles it, so the error reaches the agent on the session's next
  call.
- Page clipboard: in a tab a session created, no page script writes the
  system clipboard. An agent's click, key or evaluated script gives the
  page a user gesture, and WebKit lets a page holding one write the system
  clipboard through the asynchronous Clipboard API (WebKit's UI process
  writes it through `+[NSPasteboard generalPasteboard]`, also off the main
  thread) and through `execCommand("copy")` or `"cut"` (written by name,
  `+pasteboardWithName:`, while WebKit handles the web process's message).
  Neither message says which page sent it, so the pasteboard redirect
  cannot route them by tab, and WebKit has no setting that refuses
  `execCommand("copy")` to a page in a gesture. So once a session creates
  the tab (or a popup of one), the driver turns WebKit's
  `AsyncClipboardAPIEnabled` feature off for that web view (`tabs.open`
  fails with `unsupported` on a WebKit without that switch, and a web view
  where it does not take gets an empty document with no script; no
  `navigator.clipboard`, `Clipboard` or `ClipboardItem` in any of its
  documents, already-loaded ones included) and adds
  `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-browser-host/js/page-clipboard.js` at document start in the page
  world of every frame. That script supplies a `navigator.clipboard` and
  `ClipboardItem` whose writes (a promised item once it settles) reach the
  tab's clipboard through a script message handler; they need no transient
  activation, since they reach only that tab and WebKit resets the page's
  activation after each script the driver evaluates, also between an agent
  click's press and release. It rejects their reads with `NotAllowedError`,
  and replaces `execCommand` so `copy` and `cut` fire the page's handlers with a
  `DataTransfer` and put what they set, or the selection, on the tab's
  clipboard; WebKit's own command never runs from page script there. The
  guard stays on the web view for its life, also after the session leaves
  (later writes then fail). Residual, measured on macOS 27.0 (26A428): WebKit
  gives user scripts to a document when it commits, not to a frame's
  initial empty document (an iframe whose `src` is still loading or is a
  `javascript:` URL, a window the page opened before its first load
  commits). Same-origin page script that reaches such a document while it
  holds a gesture can call that document's own `execCommand("copy")`, and
  WebKit writes the system clipboard. No fix is known within WebKit's API:
  `WKUserScript` has no option to match such documents (its private
  initializers take URL patterns, an associated URL, a content world and
  deferral only), no WebKit preference refuses `execCommand("copy")` to a
  page in a gesture (`JavaScriptCanAccessClipboard` only widens it), no UI
  delegate method is called for a page's copy, and the UI process's
  pasteboard write runs in a handler whose only per-page argument (the IPC
  connection) no Objective-C hook can see, so the redirect cannot route it
  by page or process.
- Cookies: the domain policy applies by host, since a cookie belongs to a
  host and not an origin (a pattern's scheme and port do not narrow it).
  `cookies.clear` on a tab that shows a blocked page (its scope is that
  tab's site), and `cookies.get` or `cookies.set` with a blocked URL, fail
  with `blocked`. The runtime names the page's tab on every cookie call,
  and `cookies.get` and `cookies.set` use it only to pick the tab's data
  store, so a page showing a blocked site still sets and reads the
  cookies the policy allows. A cookie is in
  reach when a host an allowed pattern names receives it (its own domain
  or a parent domain) and its domain is not one a prohibited pattern
  names or, under `blockIPs`, an IP address; other cookies are left out of
  `cookies.get`, refused by `cookies.set` and never cleared.

## Capabilities

`driver.capabilities()` returns names the driver supports beyond this core:
`cdp`, `route` (request interception), `history` (browser history search),
`tabGroups`. The runtime exposes capability-gated APIs only when present and
otherwise throws the reference's own unsupported error text.

## Proposed changes (Swift driver)

### Native host contract (JavaScriptCore)

The app runs each REPL session in its own `JSContext` on a dedicated thread.
Before loading the runtime it installs one global, `__cmuxNative`. The runtime
(`repl-host.js`) builds `host`, timers, `fs`, `fetch` and `driver` on it. All
structured values cross the boundary as JSON strings.

| Member | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | `1` |
| `sessionId`, `cwd` | session name; absolute fs root: the CLI caller's cwd, or, when the request has none, a new directory of the session's own under the temporary directory (removed on close when empty). The app refuses `/`, the home directory and any directory containing it with an error telling the agent to `cd` to a project or scratch directory; `cmux browser repl mcp` sends no cwd when started in one of those |
| `capabilities` | array of driver capability names (`[]` on WebKit) |
| `print(level, text)` | append one output line; `level` is `log`, `info`, `warn`, `error` or `debug`; `text` is already formatted. An evaluation keeps at most 16 MiB of lines; the rest goes to `<tmpdir>/output-<evalId>.txt`, announced by a `# output continues in <path>` line and summed up by a last `# output truncated: …; full output: <path>` line |
| `setTimer(id, delayMs, repeat)` / `clearTimer(id)` | on fire the app calls `globalThis.__cmuxHostOnTimer(id)`; repeating timers keep firing until cleared, each fire `delayMs` after the previous callback ran, so a busy thread holds at most one queued callback per timer. `setTimer` returns `false`, scheduling nothing, when the session already has 10,000 timers scheduled or fired with their callback not yet run; the runtime's `setTimeout` then throws a `RangeError` |
| `driverCall(callId, method, paramsJSON)` | the app later calls `globalThis.__cmuxHostOnResult(callId, errorJSON, resultJSON)`; exactly one of the two is `null`; `errorJSON` is `{ code, message }` |
| `fetch(callId, requestJSON)` | request `{ url, method, headers: [[k, v]], bodyBase64?, targetId?, credentials?, origin? }`; result via `__cmuxHostOnResult`: `{ url, status, statusText, headers: [[k, v]], bodyBase64, redirected }`. Cookies come from, and `Set-Cookie` goes back to, the attached tab's cookie store (a cookie goes to a URL its domain matches and whose path its path matches by RFC 6265, so a `/account` cookie never goes to `/accounting`), for `credentials` `include` (default) always, `same-origin` only for URLs on `origin`, `omit` never. The domain policy is checked on the URL and every redirect hop (`blocked`); a body over 64 MiB fails; a session runs at most 16 fetches at once and queues the rest in order; when a cell times out, the fetches it started are cancelled and its queued ones fail with `cancelled`; the session redacts the URL, headers and the body (UTF-8 text as text; other bytes by each value's UTF-8 and escaped bytes, and its percent-encoded and Base64 forms) |
| `secrets(op, argsJSON)` | synchronous, `{"ok": value}` or `{"error": {code, message}}`: `set { name, value, domains, totp }`, `load { path }` (read natively) or `load { object }`, `list`, `has { name }`, `delete { name }`, `clear`. No result holds a value |
| `policy(op, argsJSON)` | synchronous, as `secrets`: `get` → `{ allowed, prohibited, blockIPs, locked }`, `check { url }` → reason or `null`, `site { host }` → the host's site (registrable domain by the Public Suffix List, or the host itself when it has none), the same site `cookies.clear` scopes to, `set { allowed?, prohibited?, blockIPs?, lock?, title }` (a locked policy refuses) |
| `fs(op, argsJSON)` | synchronous; returns `{"ok": value}` or `{"error": {"code": "ENOENT"\|"EACCES"\|"EEXIST"\|"ENOTDIR"\|"EISDIR"\|"ENOTEMPTY"\|"EINVAL", "message"}}` |
| `readResource(relativePath)` | text of a bundled `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-browser-host/js/` file, or `null` |
| `tmpdir`, `homedir` | the session's private temporary directory (`<app temp>/cmux-browser-repl/<session>-<random>-tmp`, mode 0700, removed on close when empty; no other session's files are in it) and the canonical home directory, for `node:os` |

cmux-next: the Rust VM (`vm.rs`) has main's `secrets(op)` and `policy(op)`
(port plan decision D1), with these differences: a secret is a
`{__secret: name}` handle that `input.insertText { text }` and the page
agent's `fill` carry (not `input.insertText { secret }`); `policy set` only
narrows (the host intersects with the user's layer); `policy site` answers
from a compact suffix list until the host has a Public Suffix List (D6);
`policy log` returns the host's own log of navigations it blocked before
their request, plus the session's tabs' unrouted events (`blocked:
"unrouted"`, see "Sessions and tabs"); `secrets load` keys come back in sorted order. The host keeps
the runtime's entry points and removes them and `__cmuxNative` before the
first cell. `fs` has no `lstat` yet, and `fetch` answers `unsupported`.

`fs` ops, paths relative to `cwd` (absolute paths must stay inside `cwd` or
the session's own `tmpdir`, never the system temporary directory that other
sessions and apps share, except files the driver reported through
`download.finished`, which are readable): `readFile {path}` → base64 (secrets redacted, text or bytes), `writeFile {path, base64, append?}`,
`mkdir {path, recursive?}`, `readdir {path}` → `[{ name, type }]`,
`stat {path}` → `{ size, type: "file"|"directory"|"symlink"|"other", mtimeMs, birthtimeMs }`,
`lstat {path}` (as `stat`, for the link itself), `rm {path, recursive?, force?}`,
`rename {from, to}`, `copyFile {from, to}`, `exists {path}` → boolean,
`resolve {path}` → absolute path. `rm` refuses `cwd` and `tmpdir`
themselves.

Symbolic links follow Node. `rm`, `rename` and `lstat` act on the link itself
and check only that its parent directory is inside a root, so a link pointing
outside can be removed, moved or described; `rm` of a link to a directory
never touches the directory. Every other op reads or writes through the link
and checks where it points, so such a link is never followed out of the
roots, and a dangling link is refused for writing. `readdir` reports a link as
`symlink`. `rename` uses `rename(2)` and `copyFile` copies to a temporary
file beside the destination before renaming it into place, so an existing
destination stays intact until the new file is complete.
Every `fs` operation of every session runs under one process-wide lock from
its path check to its last system call, so a session moving a link (agent
code cannot create one) never changes what another session's checked path
reaches.

Entry points the runtime defines, called by the app:

- `__cmuxReplEval(code)` returns a Promise; the app awaits it with the eval
  timeout (120 s by default). Rejection is an uncaught error; the
  app formats it with `__cmuxFormatError(error)` when defined, else
  `error.stack ?? String(error)`, and the CLI exits 1. At the timeout the
  app answers the caller at once; a script still running is terminated
  (`JSContextGroupSetExecutionTimeLimit`), then `__cmuxReplCancel(message)`
  settles the cell so the next one runs.
- The runtime (`repl-host.js`) keeps `__cmuxNative` in its closures and
  deletes the global, and its own `CmuxBrowserRepl` namespace, before any
  cell runs. Once the runtime has loaded, the app takes the entry points
  (above and below) and deletes their globals, so no cell can call them.
- Every call the app makes into the context (a cell, a driver result, a
  timer, an event, a cancel) is bounded, since agent code can start work
  outside a cell (timers, event handlers): one that starts while a cell
  runs ends at that cell's timeout; one that started outside a cell, or
  whose cell has ended, is terminated after 10 s. A cell runs from when
  the session's thread starts it, so a callback queued ahead of a
  submitted cell counts as outside a cell. After the session closes
  (`cmux browser repl reset`, idle expiry) every script is terminated and
  the app makes no further call into the context.
- `__cmuxHostOnEvent(name, payloadJSON)` delivers every driver event.
- `__cmuxHostOnTimer(id)`, `__cmuxHostOnResult(callId, errorJSON, resultJSON)`.

Script load order: `manifest.json` in `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-browser-host/js/`,
`{ "repl": [...], "agent": [...] }`, paths relative to that directory. `repl`
scripts run in order in the REPL context; `agent` scripts install in order in
the agent world. A missing or malformed manifest, or a listed file that does
not exist, fails the evaluation with an error naming the path; nothing is
skipped. `cmux browser repl guide` prints `guide.md` from the same directory
when present.

### Agent world

- The world is `WKContentWorld.world(name: "cmux-agent")`. Scripts are added to
  a tab's `WKUserContentController` (document start, all frames) when a
  session first touches the tab; frames that loaded earlier get the scripts on
  the first `frame.evaluate`.
- `frame.evaluate` sends `source` as `(<source>)(...args)` through
  `callAsyncJavaScript`, so `awaitPromise` is always true on WebKit.
- `frameId` values are opaque strings. `null`/omitted means the main frame.
- The agent is installed with the recipe in `page-agent.js` and found at
  `globalThis[Symbol.for("cmux.browserRepl.agent")]`; `input.setFiles`
  resolves the handle there, assigns files with `DataTransfer` and dispatches
  `input` and `change`.
- `frame.evaluate` with `world: "page"` and `handles`: handles live in the
  agent world, so the driver moves them through the DOM. The page world
  registers a one-off capturing listener for a random event type, the agent
  world dispatches that event on each element, and the page world reads the
  targets, then runs `source`. Detached elements fail with `stale`.
- Evaluation errors carry `{ code, message, errorName }`; page exceptions use
  code `evaluation`.
- `tab.info` answers from native state (URL, title, `isLoading`) while a
  JavaScript dialog is open, since page script is blocked then.
- `frameId` is WebKit's frame handle id (`-[WKFrameInfo _handle].frameID`);
  frames come from `-[WKWebView _frames:]`.
- Network events come from `-[WKWebView _setResourceLoadDelegate:]`; without
  that SPI no `request`/`response` events are sent.

## Proposed changes (runtime)

Needs found while building `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-browser-host/js` against the `dev` driver.
The dev driver implements all of them.

- `frame.contentFrame { targetId, frameId, element }` returns `{ frameId }` of
  the frame an `<iframe>` agent handle hosts, or `null`. The runtime uses it
  for frame locators, DOM-order frame prefixes and snapshot stitching. Without
  it (`unsupported`) the runtime finds no frame for an iframe: matching the
  iframe's box against each child's `frame.ownerBox` would guess, and
  overlapping iframes share a box.
- `frame.contentFrames { targetId, frameId, elements: [handle] }` returns one
  `{ frameId }` or `null` per handle, in order: every iframe of a frame in one
  call. Snapshots use it; without it (`unsupported`) they call
  `frame.contentFrame` per iframe.
- Frame calls must not cost a frame-tree walk each. The app's driver keeps
  one tree read per tab (`BrowserReplFrameRegistry`), finds a frame by id
  without a read, and gives callers that need the current tree
  (`frames.list`, `frame.contentFrame(s)`, `frame.ownerBox`) a read that starts
  after their request, shared with concurrent callers.
- `frame.evaluate` takes `handles: [agentHandleId]`. The driver resolves them
  to elements in the target world and passes them before `args`, so
  `locator.evaluate` and `evaluateAll` run user functions in the page world on
  elements the agent world found. On WebKit this needs a cross-world lookup,
  for example through `__cmuxPageAgent.resolveHandle`.
- `tab.info` must answer while a JavaScript dialog is open (page script is
  blocked then): return the last known `title` and `loadState`. `loadState`
  is `commit`, `domcontentloaded` or `load`; the runtime polls it for
  `waitForLoadState` and `waitForURL`.
- An `input.mouse` `up` that opens a dialog may stay pending until
  `dialog.respond`; events such as `dialog.opened` must still arrive while
  the call is pending, because the runtime answers dialogs from them.
- `input.key` carries the resolved `key` (`C` for Shift+KeyC), `code`,
  `location`, and `text` only when the key inserts text (none while Meta,
  Control or Alt is held).
- The page agent exposes `globalThis[Symbol.for("cmux.browserRepl.agent")]`
  and `globalThis.__cmuxPageAgent.resolveHandle(id)`, both non-enumerable.
  Handle ids are strings (`h12`), stable per element for the document's life.
- Host: `importModule(specifier)` is optional (absent in the app).
  `fetchHandlesCookies` is implied by the native `fetch` contract, so the
  runtime does not add a `Cookie` header itself there.
